<h2><a name="het_anat">Guided Tour of an Example MSB (Beam-Switched Sample) </a> </h2>

    Go to the JCMT root window, and open the ACSIS library by clicking on :<p>

   <img src="het_images/het_library.gif" alt="Contents of the
		heterodyne library"><p>

       A window will pop up containing a list of folders. The
    little switch on the left of the folder icons is an open/close
    toggle switch. Push open the folder titled "Samples" and then
    select the MSB labeled "Beam-switch sample(1X) " and click "Copy" on the toolbar.<p>

    <img src="het_images/het_copy.gif" alt="Copying an MSB" ><p>

      Now go back to your Science Program window, and click on
      "Paste". The MSB will be dropped into your science
      program. Congratulations! You're now well underway. Now is a
      good time to save your progress, so use the File->Save option in
      your Science Program window and carry on.
<!-- ############################################################################ -->

    <h2><a name="ria">Really Important Aside - or is it Inside? </a></h2>

Do you see how the icon for the MSB is not directly below the icon for
the Science Program but indented to the right? That's because the MSB
is <em>inside</em> the Science Program. This is a classic way of
representing a hierarchical structure, and many of you will be
familiar with it from other applications, such as the "Manage
Bookmarks" screen in the Netscape and Mozilla browsers.


    <h2><a name="het_etmc">Editing the MSB  component</a></h2>

    <p> Click on the title of the MSB. This will activate the MSB
    editor panel on the right section of your window.<p>


      The properties of an MSB are very simple. 

      <ul>

      <li>It has a title, at the moment "Beam-switch sample".  When
 preparing your own MSB, this title should be changed to something
 meaningful describing the observation, usually with target
 name. Examples might be "B/SW observation of OMC1" or "3 point grid
 of M83". <strong>Please</strong> take the time to do this - it
      really helps the person doing the observing.

      <li>A pull down menu with a repeat counter. Leave that to 1 for
      the time being.

      <li>The priority of the MSB. Note that this only affects the
      internal priority of your MSBs - not the priority allocated to
      your entire project by your TAG. So if you had two different
      MSBs that rose to the top of the scheduling queue and one had
      priority "1" and the other "99", the one marked "High" will
      normally get done first. If all your MSBs are of equal interest
      to you, just don't bother changing the default.

	<small>Small print: Bear in mind though that MSB selection is
	an operational decision - marking your MSBs with priorities 1,
	2, 3 etc is no guarantee that they will be done in precisely
	that particular order. For example, your lower-priority MSBs
	could be done because they are observable at a time of day
	where there is not much else in the queue, whereas your
	high-priority MSBs could be competing against the top-ranked
	project. Also, the observer/TSS may sometimes select a lower
	priority MSB because it is the most efficient choice at the
	time, because of its duration or azimuth.</small>

    </ul>

There is also a display of the OT's estimate of how long the MSB
will take (which is not yet functional). 

<!-- ############################################################################ -->
<h2><a name="het_eoam">Elements of an MSB</a></h2>

    Click on the push lever to open up your MSB. Inside you will find
    a Het Setup component, a Site Quality component and an observation
    component which is labelled "Science Target" at the moment:<p>

<img src="het_images/het_elements.gif" alt="Inside an MSB" ><p>

     We'll now go through these individually.
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_thsc">The Het Setup component</a></h2>

<p> If you click on the "Het Setup" component, the properties of that
 component are shown in the right hand side of the science program
 window, as shown below. The purpose of this component is to enable
 the set up of the required heterodyne instrument and ACSIS prior to an
 observation. </p>
 

<img src="het_images/het_het_setup.gif" alt="Het Setup component" ><p>
<p> Four boxes are displayed on the right side of the window, two of
	      which are editable. 

<h3>Front End Configuration</h3>
<ul>
<li> The first item in the Het Setup component enables the user to
		choose the required receiver. Choose from A3 or B3.
		(W(C) has been retired, and W(D) and 
		HARP are not yet supported in the OT. Note the tuning
		range, i.e. the frequency range over which the
		selected receiver can be tuned, displayed in the
		top-right corner. 

<li> The next item in the list allows one to specify the number of
		spectral regions.  When fully implemented, this will
		allow one to use the <a href="het_freq_ed">frequency
		  editor</a> to observe up to four different
		frequencies within the passband.  Currently, only one
		spectral region is supported.

<li> When fully implemented, "Special Configurations" will allow one
		to observe two or more commonly observed spectral
		lines simultaneously, such as certain close pairs of
		formaldehyde lines, or 13CO & C18O J=3-2.  Currently
		not supported.

<li> The next  item allows the user to choose between a single or
		a dual mixer observation. For receiver A, there is
		only one mixer, so only "single mixer" will be
		allowed. Receivers B3 and W have two mixers, sensitive
		to orthogonal polarisations of the incoming
		radiation. Typically, observations use both mixers
		simultaneously, and the outputs from each mixer are
		averaged together to increase the signal-to-noise for
		a given integration time.  With ACSIS (and unlike with
		the DAS), choosing one or two mixers has no effect on
		the resolution of the spectra.

<li> The Bandwidth menu item allows the user to select the required
		bandwidth (in MHz). The resulting spectral resolution
		(in kHz) is shown automatically updated in the "res"
		entry in the Frequency Configuration table at the
		bottom of the Het Setup menu. 



<li> The next item allows the user to choose between double sideband
		(dsb) and single sideband (ssb) operation. Note
		receiver A has no single sideband capabilities, so
		"dsb" is the only allowed option. 
 
<li> The next menu allows the user to request which sideband is used
		to observe with. Sideband suppression is not absolute
		in the SSB receivers, so the user should avoid, if
		possible, the situation where the unwanted sideband
		corresponds to a frequency where the zenith opacity or
		receiver noise is high. If either sideband is okay,
		choose "best" and the TSS will use his or her
		discretion when making the observation. 

</ul>

<h3>Frequency Setup</h3>


 <p>In order to indicate receiver tuning, the user needs to indicate
	      the  rest frequency of the spectral line observation.
	      In addition, one <i>may</i> indicate the source velocity
	      and frame in the Frequency Setup box, but the default practice is now to specify these values with the other source information in
	    the <a href="#het_tcc">Target Information</a> component.
	    (In fact, specifying the source velocity in the <i>Frequency
	      Setup</i> box is also not yet supported.  Currently you
	    <i>must</i> specify source velocity in the <a
	      href="#het_tcc">Target Information</a> component.) 
	    The rest frequency of 
 the line can be set by choosing the required molecule and transition from the
 pull-down menus, or by entering the frequency manually, in GHz, in the
 frequency field. Note
  that manually entering frequency values in the rest frequency field
 causes the molecule and transition menus take on values of "No
 Line", even if the frequency does in fact correspond to a known
 transition. Look-up occurs from molecule/transition to frequency only -
 no look-up is done in the opposite direction. After manually entering a frequency
 one has to click on accept (next to the frequency which will change from red to
 black)

 <p>The <i>Frequency Setup</i> configuration also includes a
	      "Frequency Editor" tool. This 
 can be useful in setting choosing your observing frequencies and
 bandwidths, particularly where you might want to observe several
 lines at once with DSB receivers, when using special ACSIS
	      configurations, or to check the atmospheric opacity at
	      the observed (or sideband) frequency.  This section will
	    be updated when ACSIS special configurations become supported.<p>

<p><i>If the source has a very high velocity (which might
		put the line into the band of another receiver), 
	    one can
		choose the rest frequency and put the redshift in the
		target component.</i>

 

<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_tsc">Rarely Used Components: Site Quality</a></h2>
 
    The Site Quality component specifies any weather-related
    scheduling requirements for an MSB. Click on the Site Quality
    component to get the Site Quality panel:<p>

    <img src="het_images/het_site_quality.gif" alt="Site Quality Component" ><p>

     You probably don't need to change anything here, except if your
program is using different receivers (where you don't want an RxW
project done in grade 5 weather or an RxA project in grade 2
weather). The default value of tau of "Allocated" means that your MSB
can be scheduled when the tau is in the range that was specified by
your TAG for your project. The default value of the sub-millimetre
seeing is "Don't Care".

<p>If you think you need to change these values, click
     on the note entitled "Note: Site Quality" which contains a
     lengthy explanation, but don't get bogged down in this for
     now. DO NOT request a tau value outside your TAG allocation.
Your MSB will never be carried out if you do, since
the scheduling software requires firstly, that the current tau  
is within your TAG allocation and then, only once this condition 
has been met, that the current tau is within your range of personal
	      preference.<p>


<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_tsched">Rarely Used Components: Scheduling Constraints</a></h2>
 
<p>    The Scheduling Constraints component allows one to restrict or
	    broaden the time over which an MSB will be selected. To
	    insert this component, click on the <i>Component</i>
	    button on the left side near the bottom of the OT window,
	    and select the "Sched. Constraints".  <p>

    <img src="het_images/het_sched_constraints.gif" alt="Scheduling
		Constraints Component" >
<p>
The main reason you might want to insert this component is if your
	      science targets have a very low (i.e. &delta; &lt; ~-35
	      deg) or very high (i.e. &delta; &gt; ~+80 deg)
	      declination.  By default, MSBs are only selected when
	      the sources are above about 30deg elevation, so low- and
	      high- declination sources may never be selected unless
	      you specify a lower minimum elevation.  Similarly,
	      sources at ~19deg declination transit almost directly
	      overhead, and you may wish to restrict such sources to
	      be selected when they're not so high.

<p>Another reason to insert this component is if your observations are
	      time-critical, i.e. they must not be done before a
	      certain date or after a certain date.  This can be
	      specified by changing the Earliest and/or Latest
	      Schedule Date.  

<p>You may also need to use this component if you have a project which
	      requires periodic observations, for example if you were
	      monitoring a variable source.  In that case, you can
	      specify the repeat time in the "Reschedule every..." box.


<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_drrecipe">DRRecipe Component</a></h2>

<p>When fully implemented, this component will allow you to specify
	      how the data reduction pipeline will handle these data.
	      For now, just ignore it (but don't remove it!).


<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_tfoc">The observation: Science Target</a></h2>

    Now click on the science target to bring up its panel. If you recursively open all of the toggle switches, the individual components of the science target will be displayed as a hierarchy, as shown below.<p>
 
    <img src="het_images/sci_tar.gif" alt="Science target" ><p>

 The first element inside the Science target is the "Target
      information" component. We will discuss this shortly. Next there
      is a sequence iterator which contains a repeat iterator, a chop
      iterator and a single "eye". The sequence iterator doesn't do
      anything per se, so you can ignore it for the moment, but it is
      important to note that it represents the sequence of events at
      the telescope. The repeat iterator allows the user to control
      the number of repeats carried out for a certain observation. The
      "eye" icon represents the observation itself. Before explaining
      the function of each of these elements, the nomenclature of the
      elements of a general MSB will be reviewed. <p>

<h2><a name="thingies">Components, Iterators And All That</a></h2>

We've talked about several things so far, so it's time to have a quick
run down. <p>

<ul>

      <li> <img src="images/icon_msb.gif" alt="*">MSBs
      <strong>are</strong> individually schedulable blocks and
      <strong>contain</strong> one or more fully specified science
      observation and any calibrations. For heterodyne observations,
      calibrations will be described in a show-to-observer note.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_observation.gif" alt="*">Observations
      <strong>are</strong> observations of a single astronomical
	target and <strong>contain</strong> components and a sequence.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_component.gif" alt="*">Components
      <strong>are</strong> configurators for the JCMT systems such as
      the instrument (het setup component), the telescope (Target
      component) and the scheduler (Site Quality component). <p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_iterator.gif" alt="*">Iterators
      <strong>are</strong> potentially multiple actions and
      <strong>contain</strong> other iterators and one or more
      eyes.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_eye.gif" alt="*">Eyes
      <strong>are</strong> actions that results in the actual taking
      of data - a single data file per eye to be precise.<p>


      <li><img src="images/icon_note.gif" alt="*">Notes
      <strong>are</strong> a repository of useful information and can
      go anywhere.<p>

</ul>
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_tcc">The target component</a></h2>

    Click on the target component to bring up its panel:<p>
    
   <img src="het_images/het_target.gif" alt="The Target component" ><p>

<p>In this component you will enter the coordinates and velocity of
	      the source, and the coordinates of the reference
	      position (for position-switched observations).  

<p>The "Target Type" is a pull-down menu that allows you to select
	      RA/Dec (most common), Orbital Elements (for comets,
	      etc.), or a Named Planet.  The window changes for each
	      selection. 

<p>For RA/Dec targets, enter the R.A. and Dec. in the appropriate
	      boxes, using colons as separators.  One of several
	      different coordinate systems can be selected with
	      another pull-down menu, such as J2000, B1950, etc.  For
	      the moment, it would be wise to avoid galactic
	      coordinates, since this is not yet properly implemented.

<p>It is now necessary to specify the radial velocity of the source in
	      the target component, either as a radio, optical, or
	      relativistic velocity, or redshift (z).  

<p>To specify a reference position, click on "REFERENCE".  The default
	      is to enter the offset (in arcseconds) from the source
	      position, but by unchecking the "Offset" button, you can
	      enter an absolute position for the reference.  

<p>If you don't have or know of a reference position, then <i>{This
		  bit needs to be completed...}</i>
      
<p>Instead of entering the source coordinates manually, if you are using
      a machine with an Internet connection you can try  entering the name
      of your target (in our example the IRAS source 18592+0108),
	      select the on-line catalogue to search (i.e. SIMBAD or
	      NED) from the pull-down menu, and
      hit "Resolve Name".

      After a brief pause the RA and DEC co-ordinate fields are
      populated with the SIMBAD/NED co-ordinates for the source. The
      SIMBAD/NED name for the source will also be indicated next to the
      "Resolve Name" button.  And of course, double check that the
      co-ordinates are those you intend to observe.<p>
       
<!--      N.B. Not all ACSII characters are allowed in the target name -
      make sure your target name is built up of only the following
      characters A-Z, a-z 0-9,+,- and _. -->


      But wait - that's not all.<p>
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_tpe">The position editor</a></h2>

    You can <a href="#het_tci">skip</a> this section if you want because you don't have to do
    anything, but it's kind of cool and can be very useful in picking
    a good chop position. Click on the plot button at the bottom left
    of the target panel:<p>

      A whole new window will pop up - this is the position
      editor. Looks a bit boring at the moment though, with just a
      small green crosshair in the middle. Let's make it a bit more
      interesting - go to Catalog menu and into the Image Servers item
      and chose a Digital Sky Survey near near you:<p>

   <img src="het_images/het_tpe.gif" alt="The Position editor"><p>

      It's now full of stars. The display application, by the way, is
      is based on JSky, for those familiar with it. <p>

      If you're having problems with the position editor, the most likely explanation is that your version(s) of JRE, JAI and/or java may not be sufficiently up-to-date; check the <a href="download.html">download page</a> for more information.  If you are behind a firewall, you may need to check your <a href="advanced.html#proxy">proxy server settings</a>.<p>

      The DSS may not be the most useful survey for planning
      sub-millimetre observations, but you can read in any FITS image
      with an appropriate WCS header using Open under the File
      menu. You can also fetch a FITS image over the Web.

      In the screenshot below I have loaded the SCUBA commissioning
      scan map of W48 <em>(image courtesy Tim Jenness)</em>. If you
      have an Internet connection, go to the File menu, select "Open
      URL...:" and type in the following URL: <a
      href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/software/jcmtot/w48.fits">http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/software/jcmtot/w48.fits</a>
      or download the image by clicking on the link and and use
      File-&gt;Open to read it in. Notice that the RA/DEC position
      fields of the target component must be set reasonably near to
      the world co-ordinate of the FITS file otherwise the image may
      not load properly.<p>

      <img src="images/w48.gif" alt="W48"><p>

      You will then see the DSS image replaced with the sub-millimetre
      image.<p>

      <blockquote>
      <small>A short technical note if you are planning on generating your own
      image for import: if you want to import a SCUBA map in NDF format,
      convert it to FITS by using the <a
      href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk">Starlink</a> <a

      utility with the following arguments:

<pre>ndf2fits encoding=FITS-IRAF bitpix=32 comp=D</pre>

    If you have difficulty despite doing this, let us know.</small></blockquote>


    <p>As I mentioned before, the green cross-hair is the position of
    your science co-ordinates. Click on the button on the left side of
    the position editor entitled "Sci Area". The circle that is drawn
    is the HPBW of the chosen heterodyne receiver.<p>

    Now for the useful thing I mentioned earlier. While leaving the
    position editor window open, go back to your science program
    window and click on your chop iterator that is inside your science
    observation. Now look at the position editor. The chop beams and
    the area in which they will rotate during integration are
    drawn. Well, that's no good - we're chopping onto bright stuff! 
    <p>

 <img src="het_images/het_bright_chop.gif" alt="bright stuff"><p>

    This is where the position editor comes into its own. We are going
    to use it to specify where exactly we would like to chop. In the
    chop iterator, use the drop down menu to change the chopping
    co-ordinate frame from AZEL to TRACKING (i.e. RA/DEC). You will
    notice that in the position editor the uncertainty circles have
    disappeared, since we will always chop in the same position in the
    sky:<p>

      <img src="het_images/het_tracking_chop.gif" alt="Chop and the Position Editor"><p>
	   
 Now back in the position editor, click on the Drag button on the
 upper left side of the window. The click on the centre of one of the
	   chop beams in the display and drag it away from the emission:<p>

      <img src="het_images/het_tracking_chop2.gif" alt="Dragging the Chop"><p>

      You will note that the values in the chop iterator have
      automatically changed to reflect the new chop throw and angle
      values. Neat, eh? Remember that by default, any calibrations for
      you observations will be preformed with the same chop as the
      science observation. <p>

      You can also click on the target component and use Drag to
      change your science co-ordinates if you wish. 
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_toi">The offset iterator</a></h2>

 <p> This iterator enables the user to specify the
 required pointings for the observation. <p>

<p>
 Suppose the user requires three pointings along the long axis of a
 galaxy, at a half beam width spacing of 10 arcseconds. Let us assume the long axis of the
 galaxy has a position angle of 30 degrees on the sky. First enter the
 position angle in the "P.A." field. The rotated frame has axes
 labeled p and q, so in order to obtain the required pointings along
 our galaxy we require (p,q) offsets of (0,-10), (0,0) and (0,10). One
 adds a new pointing by clicking on the "new" button. One then modifies
 the offsets via the p and q boxes directly above the "new"
 button. The highlighted pointing can be removed using the "remove"
 button. The "Rm. all" button removes all of the user-added
 pointings. The arrow buttons to the right of the box displaying the
 pointings allow the pointings to be re-ordered. The highlight pointing
 can be advanced one position up or down the pointing list, or to the
 top or bottom of the list by clicking on these arrow buttons. For our
 example, the completed offset iterator will appear as shown below. <p>

 <img src="het_images/het_offset1.gif" alt="The Offset Iterator (1)" ><p>

  If you want to see what the rotated offsets are in the sky
  frame (which will be the co-ordinate frame specified in the "target
  information" element), click and hold the "Display Rotated Offsets"
  button.<p> 

  The offset iterator has the ability to automatically generate
  regularly spaced grids without the need to enter each pointing
  individually. The "Grid Pattern" section of the "Offset iterator"
  allows the user to specify the offset of the map centre (relative to
  the co-ordinate in the Target information box), the grid point
  spacing and the dimensions of the grid, in grid points. To create a
  3x3 grid, with a ten arcsecond spacing, one would fill in the fields
  of the grid pattern section as ilustrated below, and then click on
  either "Create" or "Create/Centre on Base" button. The pointings
  generated then appear in the pointing list box above. Notice that
  "Create" created a grid where the (0,0) point is at the top left
  hand corner of the map, whereas  "Create/Centre on Base" chooses the
  point the geometrical centre of the grid for the (0,0) position. This will only
  correspond to a pointing position for grids with odd p and q dimensions. The
  screenshot below show the result of clicking on the  "Create/Centre

    <h2><a name="het_tci">The chop iterator</a></h2>

    Click on the chop iterator:<p>


    <img src="het_images/het_chop.gif" alt="The Chop Iterator" ><p>

      The chop iterator has a list of chop configurations (in this
      example only one 60 arcsecond chop). Each chop needs to be
	      specified by a throw, 
      an angle, and co-ordinate frame of the angle. In this example
      the frame is AZEL (Azimuth Elevation) but other common options
      are TRACKING (RA & Dec) or FPLANE (Focal Plane, i.e. Nasmyth for
      SCUBA). A 60 arcsecond chop with an angle of 90 degrees AZEL
      (i.e. 60 arcsec in the azimuth direction) is typical for
      beamswitched observations of compact sources. If the source is
      extended, one might want to increase the chop throw, or if the
      source was elongated in one direction on the sky, chop relative
      to the RA/DEC frame. Maximum recommended chop throw is 180 arcsec.<p>

 <h2><a name="het_sample">The photom/sample eye</a></h2>

  The science observation itself is represented within the MSB by the
 photom/sample eye. Click on it to display the details of the
 observation. The pull down menu near the top of the right hand frame
 allows the user to choose from beam switching, position switching,
 fast or slow frequency switching, or none.  In this example we are
	    beam-switching, and the chop throw was set with the <a
	      href="#het_tci">chop iterator</a>.  In the "Secs per offset
	    sample" box, enter the total on-source integration time
	    required in seconds. (Note this is different from how it's
	    been done in the past.) The estimated RMS noise per
	    channel is shown in the "Noise" box.<p>

 <img src="het_images/het_eye.gif" alt="The photom/sample eye" ><p>

    <h2><a name="het_time">The repeat iterator and integration time in general</a></h2>

    Back to your Science Program window now. Click on the Repeat
    iterator. It's only property is a repeat counter:<p>

      <img src="het_images/het_repeat.gif" alt="The Repeat Iterator" ><p>

      The repeat iterator acts on things that are
      <strong>inside</strong> the repeat iterator (i.e. indented under
      it) in turn. So if you set it to 2, your science observation
      consist of two spectral line samples i.e you will end up with
      precisely two GSD files. If you require a long integration of a
      source, it makes sense to break the observation down into
      shorter integrations of around ten minutes or so, so that data
      quality can be assessed as the observation progresses. In
      practice, you set up the integration time required per GSD file
      using the photom/sample eye and then use the repeat iterator to
      define a sufficient number of repeats to give the total required
      integration time.<p>

      Now you can see how your time usage builds up. Working our way
      inside out (and bottom to top): <p>

<ul>
      <li><img src="images/icon_eye.gif" alt="*"> The photom/sample
      eye  is set to an on-source integration time (and shows you the
      estimated RMS noise) which will end up in a single file.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_iterator.gif" alt="*">The Repeat
      iterator multiplies the number of times the sample is carried
      out. If you increase it from the default of 1, don't forget to
      take that into account when calculating how deep you will go.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_component.gif" alt="*">The observation
      component shows you the estimated time of the sequence it
      contains. (Not yet fully implemented.)<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_msb.gif" alt="*">The MSB component
      will give you the estimated time of the observations inside
      it. For the heterodyne OT, you only need to define MSBs for
      your science observations. Obviously, before the observation,
      the TSS will tune the receiver and focus the telescope, and
      perform a spectral line fivepoint. Specific calibration
      instructions, for example, the observation of a spectral line
      standard and/or a planet should be described in the note attached
      to the MSB. Be sure to remember to click the show-to-observer
      tick box for the note. In conclusion, the estimated time for an MSB only includes
      observations of the science target - one should remember there
      will be instrument set up and calibration overheads on top of
      this when planning your observing program. <i>{Is this still true?}</i><p>

      <li><img src="images/sci_prog.gif" alt="*">The Science Program will give you the estimated time of all
      MSBs inside it including the number of repeats. So if you have a
      1hr MSB (as in this example) and you set the MSB counter to 2,
      your MSB estimated time will be 1hr and your Science Program
      time will show 2hrs.

</ul>

    I hope that makes sense.
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
<h2> <a name="het_note">Adding information in "Note" elements </a></h2>


  By default, the heterodyne library MSBs contain one note element at
 the beginning of the MSB. This consists of a text window where you
 can include textual information, with the option of showing the note
 to the observer and TSS at the time the observation is made. If you
 click on the note icon, the right hand panel allows you to enter the
 name of the note and the main text body of the note. The
 "Show to observer" check-box should be checked if you want the
 note to be visible for the observer/TSS at the time of
 observation. It is strongly recommended that each of your MSBs
 contains at least one "Show to observer" note. All of the information
 about the observation not covered by other elements of the MSB should
 be included in "show to observer" notes. This would be much of the
 material which would have previously gone into the "Overall Strategy"
 and "Observing Cookbook" sections of heterodyne observing
 templates. It is important to note that calibration details are
 not explicitly included in heterodyne MSBs as they are for SCUBA MSBs, so
 the heterodyne observer should spell out the required calibration
 observations in a "show to observer" note.<p>

 <img src="het_images/het_note.gif" alt="A note example" ><p>


 Setting the "Show to observer" tick box brings up a "Completion
 Parameter" and "binning" field. These should contain information which
 enables the observer and TSS to decide when to consider your
 observation to be complete. The "Completion
 Parameter" should include a value for the total
 expired time, or a required signals-to-noise or RMS noise value. The
 assumed bin size, either in km/s or MHz, should be entered in the
 "Binning" field. The above screenshot shows an example of a typical "Show to
 observer"  for an extragalactic spectral line observation.<p>

 Additional notes can be inserted at any point in the MSB from the
 icon menu and you may have more than one "show to observer" notes in
 an MSB. For example, you could choose to insert a "show to observer"
 note above the "chop" element to clarify the use of an unusual
 chopping scheme.<p>  

    Finally, there is no need to repeat information in notes that is already included
   in other components of the MSB. This might include receiver tunings,
   chop throws, offset positions and science targets. All of these
   should be set up in the appropriate MSB components. If they are
   reproduced in notes, there is a risk that changes made to main body
   of the MSB will not be reflected in the notes, leading to conflicts
   between the notes and the MSB components resulting in confusion at
   the telescope.<p>
 
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
<h2><a name="het_summary">Summary: Making your heterodyne MSB</a></h2>

 So far, I have described, the various elements of the MSB. I'd like
 to summarise the general procedure for making your own.<p>

<ul>

<li> Choose the corresponding MSB template from the heterodyne library
and copy/paste it to your science program.  Each of these is described
		briefly <a href="#het_supported">below</a>.

<li> Fill out the het setup component with the frontend/backend
details for your observation.

<li> Set up the site quality component, normally this means simply
leaving the "allocated" button checked. 

<li> Enter the target information for your target. This step can be as
simple as entering the RA/DEC and epoch. Don't forget there are the
useful tools of the Name resolver and the position
editor to help you out here.

<li> Set up the chop component. Again this can simply mean entering the
chop throw angle and reference frame, or this component can be set up
via the position editor.

<li> Set up the photom/sample eye. Remember the one-to-one
correspondence between the duration you set up here and the integration
time per GSD file produced.

<li> Set up the repeat counter to give the number of repeats of the
time set up in the photom/sample eye to get your total required
integration time. If you want a total integration of one hour, you should
set up an integration time of 10 minutes in the photom/sample eye and
set the repeat counter to six. When observing, you can then monitor
the observation by inspecting the GSD file produced every ten minutes,
and co-add the spectra as you go along. In general, if you want to
build up long integrations, you will want the basic sample length to
be around 10 minutes for RxW and RxB and around 15-20 minutes for RxA.

<li> Add at least one "show to observer" note. This should contain additional
information on the overall aims of your science program, details of
required calibrations and any other special notices you want the
observer and TSS to act upon when the observation is made.

<li> Click on the outermost level of the MSB. In the right hand panel
you should give the MSB a meaningful name. Below the name field, there
is pull down menu labeled "Observe". This counter allows you to
control how many times you want the whole MSB observed. If you want it
done just once, leave this as (1x). You can set the relative priority
of the MSB within your science program using the "Priority" pull down
menu. Set this between 1 and 99, with 1 signifying the highest
priority.
</ul>

 That's pretty much all you need to know to start preparing your
 MSB. The remainder of this primer covers the rest of the Heterodyne
 MSB library and the frequency editor tool in the heterodyne setup
 component. 
<!-- ############################################################################ -->

<!-- ############################################################################ -->
 <h2><a name="het_freq_ed"> The frequency editor</a></h2>    

<i>{This section is out of date.}</i>

 <p>While many users will simply complete the Het-setup component quite
 adequately following the procedure outlined above, the het-setup component includes the
 "frequency editor" tool which will prove useful to some observers -
 particularly those observing multiple spectral lines in a single
 program. To activate the tool simply, click on the "Show frequency
 Editor" button in the het-setup component.<p>


<img src="het_images/het_freq_ed.gif" alt="The frequency editor" width="100%"><p>


 Starting at the top of the window we see a rectangle labelled LSB on
 the left and a rectangle labelled USB on the right. In between these
 two rectangle we have indication of the receiver IF frequency, the
 currently selected bandwidth and the resolution. Below these items there
 is a frequency scale and vertical lines indicating the position of
 astronomical spectral lines. Below this frequency scale is a plot indicating the
 atmospheric transmission as a function of frequency. Below this is a
 frequency scale labelled "FE frequency" and below this is a scale and
 slider labelled "LO1".<p>

  The chief idea of the frequency editor is to give a visual
  representation of the observing band selected for the receiver,
  together with an indication of the spectral lines visible in that
  band. To begin with, use the het-setup component to select RxB3, the
  CO(3-2) transition, and ssb operation observing with the lower
  sideband (lsb). Enter a velocity of 0 km/s. The frequency editor
  will now show USB rectangle greyed out, and the LSB rectangle
  highlighted. Try changing the bandwidth using the "BW" pull-down
  menu. Notice that the textured lilac rectangle in the middle of the LSB
  rectangle changes size, indicating the extent of the band on the
  frequency scale directly below. Notice also that a spectral line is
  highlighted in red at the centre of the band. This is the CO(3-2)
  line you selected before opening the frequency editor tool. Now select a
  bandwidth of 920 MHz. The band, indicated by the textured lilac
  rectangle, can be seen to encompass several other spectral lines. If
  you click and hold the right mouse button near the spectral lines, a menu will 
 appear. Moving down the menu, still keeping the right mouse button
  held down, highlights the name of a spectral line on the menu and
  causes the corresponding spectral line to be highlighted in green on
  the frequency scale. This enables the identification of the spectral
  lines which may be visible in your chosen receiver passband.<p>

    The frequency scale at the bottom of the window, labelled "FE
   freq", corresponds to the observing frequency in the rest frame of
   the receiver. This is just the LO frequency plus/minus the IF
   frequency for the upper and lower sideband, respectively. The
   frequency scale immediately below the spectral lines is the "FE
   freq" doppler shifted by the velocity value and definition entered
   in the het-setup component. You will notice this scale will shift
   if you enter a non-zero velocity, and will also shift if you cahnge
   the velocity definition, e.g. from radio to optical. Note the
   frequency of the upper scale, lower scale and LO are only
   approximate because the correction from the receiver rest frame to
   the chosen rest frame cannot be made, since the time when the
   observation will be made is unknown. In fact, if you really enjoy
   working backwards, you can move the LO slider by dragging it while
   pressing the left and right mouse buttons simultaneously. As you
   might expect, this changes both frequency scales and the line rest
   frequency. Moving the LO slider can be a convenient means of choosing
   a band centre frequency such that particular spectral lines are
   included or excluded from your passband. Remember, for making the
   observation, the important parameters are the rest frequency,
   velocity, rest frame and velocity definition. These will be used to
   calculate the actual LO tuning at the time of observation, which
   will depend on the relative velocities of the receiver and the
   chosen rest frame at that time.<p>

     The frequency editor tool is particular useful when it comes to
     receivers operating in double sideband mode, where two differing
     sky frequencies end up with the same IF frequency. In this case,
     identifying spectral lines can be tricky since one does not know,
     <em> a priori</em>, which sideband they are from. Choose RxA, which has no
     sideband suppression capabilities, from the pull-down menu on the
     het-setup component. Notice that neither LSB nor USB rectangles
     are greyed out, indicating that lines from both sidebands may be
     visible in the IF passband. The apparent position of lines from
     the image sideband are a function both of the rest frequency and
     source velocity of the line chosen to be at the centre of the
     signal sideband. The frequency editor gives a useful graphical
     reperesentation of this effect, allowing one to either choose
     observing frequencies to avoid contamination, or identify unknown
     lines in the passband. The fact that the sky transmission and
     receiver noise are shown in the frequency editor tool allows the
     user to reliably choose between upper and lower sidebands when
     observing in SSB mode.<p>

     The frequency editor tool is also useful when using non-standard
     DAS configurations. As an example, choose NS_COHCN_125AB from the
     non-standard configuration menu. This mode is designed to allow
     the user to observe the CO(3-2) and HCN(4-3) lines simulataneously using the
     highest resolution 125 MHZ DAS mode. This is achieved by
     adjusting both the frontend LO frequency (to move the lines
     closer together) and the DAS LO frequency (to centre the
     subsystem on the two lines). In the frequency editor this is
     represented by a shifting of the bands covered within the LSB and
     USB sliders. You can use the spectral line identification menu to
     confirm that CO(3-2) appears in the lower sideband and upper
     sideband. Some DAS modes, e.g. NS_H2CO_125X4, use the different
     sub-bands of the DAS independently to provide a coverage useful
     for measuring two closely spaced lines accurately. If you choose
     one of these modes from the pull down menu, you will see that the
     coverage of the DAS subbands is represented by multiple LSB and
     USB sliders. If you select NS_H2CO_125X4, you should be able to
     confirm, using the line identification menu, that this
     configuration enables the simultanaeous observation of the H2CO
     lines at 218.22 GHz and 218.48 GHz with the highest DAS frequency
     resolution.  Please consult this <a

<h2><a name="het_msblib">The Heterodyne MSB library</a></h2>

<p> The heterodyne library groups the MSB templates according to whether
 the observation is to be a sample, a grid, a raster, or a jiggle
	    map.  This last mode is new to heterodyne observing, but
	    should be familiar to SCUBA observers. For samples
 and grids, the user can choose beam switching, position switching or
 fast or slow frequency switching.  Jiggle mapping uses beam-switching
	    or frequency switching (although the latter has not yet
	    been tested), and raster observations only
 allow position switching. The similarities and differences of the
 heterodyne library MSBs will be discussed below.

<ul>
<li><a href="#het_sam_folder">Single-spectrum samples</a>
  <ul><li>An old, familiar observing mode, where a single spectrum is
		    obtained  toward a single position.     </ul>
<li><a href="#het_grid_folder">Grid maps</a>
  <ul><li>Another familiar observing mode, grid mapping are used where
		  relatively small maps are required with longer
		  integration times per point.</ul>
<li><a href="#het_jig_folder">Jiggle maps</a>
  <ul><li>This mode is new to heterodyne observing at the JCMT, and
		  specifically designed for HARP although useful for
		  single "pixel" receivers as well.  This mode makes a
	      small map where the secondary mirror "jiggles" rapidly
		  over all the points in the map.</ul>
<li><a href="#het_rast_folder">Raster maps</a>
  <ul><li>This mode is useful for making large maps rapidly.</ul>
</ul>


<h3><a name="het_sam_folder"> Samples</a> </h3>

 A sample denotes an observation consisting of one pointing per science
 target, and can be beam switched, position switched, fast frequency
 switched or slow frequency switched. If you open up the position
 switched sample MSB in the heterodyne library, you will see that it
 contains the same elements as the beam-switched MSB, with the
 exception of the "chop" component. Opening the "Target Information"
 component, however, reveals two rows in the bottom right hand
 window, a SCIENCE and a REFERENCE row. Clicking on one of them allows
 the user to specify the co-ordinates of either the SCIENCE, or "on"
 position, or the REFERENCE or "off" position. The REFERENCE position
 can either be specified as a co-ordinate offset from the SCIENCE
 position, by checking the "offset" tick-box, or as an absolute
 co-ordinate, by leaving the "offset" tick-box unchecked.<p>

 For the Fast and slow frequency switching MSBs, one does not specify
 a chop or offset position, rather one specifies a frequency throw
	    within the modified "Photom/Sample" eye.  <p>

For all sample modes, the <i>total</i> integration time per sample is
	    indicated in the "Photom/Sample" eye.

<p> 
<h3> <a name="het_grid_folder">Grid Maps</a> </h3>

 Observations of a single science target, at multiple positions are
 generically referred to as Grid observations. Note that the user
 can define exactly the position offsets required from the map centre,
 and there is no requirement that the pointings form a regularly
 shaped grid. Opening the various grid MSBs in the heterodyne library
 shows they are similar to the sample MSBs except for the addition of
 an "offset" iterator. This iterator enables the user to specify the
 required pointings for the observation. <p>

 Suppose the user requires three pointings along the long axis of a
 galaxy, at a half beam width spacing of 10 arcseconds. Let us assume the long axis of the
 galaxy has a position angle of 30 degrees on the sky. First enter the
 position angle in the "P.A." field. The rotated frame has axes
 labeled p and q, so in order to obtain the required pointings along
 our galaxy we require (p,q) offsets of (0,-10), (0,0) and (0,10). One
 adds a new pointing by clicking on the "new" button. One then modifies
 the offsets via the p and q boxes directly above the "new"
 button. The highlighted pointing can be removed using the "remove"
 button. The "Rm. all" button removes all of the user-added
 pointings. The arrow buttons to the right of the box displaying the
 pointings allow the pointings to be re-ordered. The highlight pointing
 can be advanced one position up or down the pointing list, or to the
 top or bottom of the list by clicking on these arrow buttons. For our
 example, the completed offset iterator will appear as shown below. <p>

 <img src="het_images/het_offset1.gif" alt="The Offset Iterator (1)" ><p>

  If you want to see what the rotated offsets are in the sky
  frame (which will be the co-ordinate frame specified in the "target
  information" element), click and hold the "Display Rotated Offsets"
  button.<p> 

  The offset iterator has the ability to automatically generate
  regularly spaced grids without the need to enter each pointing
  individually. The "Grid Pattern" section of the "Offset iterator"
  allows the user to specify the offset of the map centre (relative to
  the co-ordinate in the Target information box), the grid point
  spacing and the dimensions of the grid, in grid points. To create a
  3x3 grid, with a ten arcsecond spacing, one would fill in the fields
  of the grid pattern section as ilustrated below, and then click on
  either "Create" or "Create/Centre on Base" button. The pointings
  generated then appear in the pointing list box above. Notice that
  "Create" created a grid where the (0,0) point is at the top left
  hand corner of the map, whereas  "Create/Centre on Base" chooses the
  point the geometrical centre of the grid for the (0,0) position. This will only
  correspond to a pointing position for grids with odd p and q dimensions. The
  screenshot below show the result of clicking on the  "Create/Centre
  on Base position" - nine points with the (0,0) position corresponding
  to the map centre. <p>

<img src="het_images/het_offset2.gif" alt="The Offset Iterator(2)"
	      ><p>

<h3> <a name="het_jig_folder">Jiggle Mapping</a> </h3>

<i>{This section needs to be written.}</i>

<h3> <a name="het_rast_folder">Rasters</a> </h3>

 The format of the position switched raster MSB is similar to the
    sample MSB, except that the "photom/sample" eye is replaced by the
    "scan/raster" eye. If you click on the "scan/raster" eye, you will
    be presented with options which enable you to set up your
    raster map. The "Area" panel on the left has a number of fields
    which allow you control the size and sampling of the raster
    map. The width and height of the map are set through the "width"
    and "height" records. The sample spacing and grid spacing and the
    postion angle of the map on the sky can also be set up by making
    entries in the appropriate records. Suppose, for example, that you
	  want to use RxA to make a 35x5 pixel map with cell size
	  7"x7".  Set the sample spacing and the scan spacing to be
	  7", then specify a map width of 238 arcsec and height of
	  28".  <p>

<img src="het_images/het_raster.gif" alt="Rasters" ><p>

  The sample time box allows the user to set the amount of
 time data is taken for for each map "point" as the receiver is
 scanned across the sky.  The RMS noise per channel of the final
	    co-added map is also indicated, as is the estimated time
	    to complete each row and the complete map.  

<p>It is possible to set the scanning direction, but for most purposes
	    this should be left to the default values.
