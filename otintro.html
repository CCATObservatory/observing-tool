        <h1>The JCMT OT primer</h1>


    This document is a primer on how to use the JCMT Observing Tool
    (JCMT OT) to prepare and submit observations for semester
    2004A (see <a href="faq.html#why">Why do I have to do this?</a>. It
    assumes that you have already downloaded and installed the
    software (see our <a href="download.html">download page</a> - make
    sure you have downloaded the latest version!). Of course if you are
    using a JAC, UKIRT or JCMT machine, the software is already
    installed. It also assumes that you understand the basic SCUBA or heterodyne
    observing techniques. If you don't, you
    are not ready for this! Consult the <a
    href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/JCMT/User_documentation/Users_guide/guide/">
    the JCMT User Guide</a> first. <p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

      Because the OT is a graphical tool, the initial description of
      how to use it will undoubtedly appear long-winded. But if you use
      the text and screen shots to give yourself some practice you'll
      find that you'll actually be able to prepare your program in a
      modest number of steps.<p>

    <h2><a name="gs">Getting started</a></h2>

    Before we get started, a few words about the OT. The purpose of
    the OT is to fully specify the observations you wish to be carried
    out at the telescope. If you are an experienced SCUBA user, you
    might want to think of it as a rather sophisticated ODF editor. It
    is quite a powerful tool; here we will simply see how to prepare a
    typical observing project and point you to further sources of
    information as necessary.<p>


      Ok, let's do this. Type <tt>jcmtot</tt> on your unix terminal.<p>


    You will see two windows pop up. One has a colour picture of the
    telescope - that's the JCMT root window. You can use its menus to
    open and save files and fetch programs from our database. The
    window with the JCMT line drawing, which pops on top of the root
    window, provides a shortcut to some of the most common startup
    actions, so we call that the startup screen:<p>

      <img src="images/startup.gif" alt="Image of startup screen"><p>

    For now, press "Create New Program" on the startup screen. The
    startup window will be replaced by an science program window.

    <h2><a name="ysp">Your science program</a></h2>

    Look at your blank science program window. It's essentially
    divided in four sections: 

    <ol>

      <li>the menu and general tool bars at the top
      <li>the program tool bar down the left side
      <li>the program panel in the middle
      <li>the editor panel on the right

</ol>


    The bar between the program panel and the editor panel can be
    dragged around to enlarge or reduce them.<p>


Currently, the only thing in your program panel is a "Science Program"
line. We'll add things to it later. For now, take the time to fill in
its details in the Science Program editor on the right. The most
important field here is the Project ID field. <em>You have to get this
right otherwise you will not be able to submit your program to
us</em>. Your project ID is what you were assigned when you submitted
your proposal for telescope time. It is of the form m04a followed by a
country letter and proposal number. You can also find your country and
proposal number in our web page of <a
href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/JCMT/Observing_info/Time_allocations/04a-allocations.html">time
allocations</a>.<p> <img src="images/sciprog.gif" alt="Science
Program window"><p>

Also on the panel are estimates of the total time the specified
program will take with and without optional observations, which are currently both 0 since we haven't specified any
observations yet. 


    <h2><a name="syp">Saving your progress</a></h2>

    Now that we've done something we can save it. Open the File menu
    in your Science Program window and choose "Save As...".<p>

      <img src="images/filesave.gif" alt="File Save menu"><p>

      You will be prompted for a filename and so on:<p>


      <img src="images/saveas.gif" alt="Save As window"><p>

      The file format is XML, which is a text (not binary) format that
      you can read in later with the OT, or email to your
      collaborators. If you have a question, you can also email your
      file to us along with your question.<p>

      You might have noticed that the title of your Science Program
      was italics and now it is normal font. When you edit a component
      of your Science Program it's title changes font to indicate that
      you need to save your work.<p>

    <h2><a name="ggtm">Getting going: The MSB</a></h2>

    Time to step back for a moment. JCMT is a flexibly scheduled
    facility. But what is it that we are actually scheduling? The
    quantum of scheduling is a Minimum Schedulable Block, or MSB. An
    MSB consists of one or more scientifically meaningful observations
    as well as any calibrations required to fully reduce the
    data. <em>An MSB will always be executed at the telescope in its
    entirety</em>. For more information see <a href="faq.html#msb">What makes
    a good MSB?</a> but for the moment bear in mind that the most
    efficient MSB consists of a 0.5 to 2 hour observation on a single
    science target and any necessary calibrations.<p>

      Since SCUBA or the heterodyne instruments are best used in a few
      well-understood ways, we have prepared for you librararies of
      MSBs that you can add to your Science Program and modify to your
      requirements. If you want to prepare a SCUBA observation go to
      the <a href="scuba_example.html"> 850/450 jiggle map tutorial</a>; if
      you want to prepare a heterodyne observation, go to the <a
      href="het_example.html"> heterodyne tutorial </a>.
