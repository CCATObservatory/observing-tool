JAC Observing Tool via Java WebStart destructions.
--------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this you already have the code.

For the sake of completeness here are the full instructions.

1a. if in Hilo ...
git clone /jac_sw/gitroot/ot.git ot

1b. if remote to the JAC ...
git clone ssh://ssh.jach.hawaii.edu/jac_sw/gitroot/ot.git ot

2. change to the code directory ...
cd ot

3. the OT is built using gmake, build the OT ...
gmake install

4. copy the compiled code to the webstart directory ...
cp -r install/lib releaseFiles/webstart
cp -r install/tools releaseFiles/webstart

5. copy the webstart directory contents to the webserver ...
cp -r releaseFiles/webstart/* /ftp/pub/ot

6. change to the webserver directory ...
cd /ftp/pub/ot

7. run the signing script ...
perl work/isign.pl

8. test it works ...
javaws http://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/ot/jac-ot.jnlp

For future installs, step 3 is repeated, step 4 also but the files are 
copied to the webserver directory. Steps 6, 7 and 8 are then repeated.
