JAC Observing Tool via Java WebStart destructions.
--------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this you already have the code.

For the sake of completeness here are the full instructions.

1. In Hilo ...
cd /jac_sw
git clone /jac_sw/gitroot/ot.git ot_release_<YYYYMMDD>

where <YYYYMMDD> is replaced with the current date.

2. change to the code directory ...
cd ot_release_<YYYYMMDD>

3. checkout the release code ...
git checkout -b release origin/release

4. the OT is no longer built using gmake, instead there are two methods
which can be used depending on circumstance. Ant ( ant.apache.org ) is
the preferred method of building, however there is also a Perl script
which can do the building. The Perl script should be phased out.

Either way, to build use one of the following ...

perl wiki-build.pl

... or ...

ant -f ant/build.xml

Building from the release branch requires Java 1.5

5. copy the compiled code to the webstart directory ...
cp -r install/lib releaseFiles/webstart
cp -r install/tools releaseFiles/webstart

6. Make a new directory in /ftp/pub ...
mkdir /ftp/pub/ot_release_<YYYYMMDD>

7. copy the webstart directory contents to the webserver ...
cp -r releaseFiles/webstart/* /ftp/pub/ot_release_<YYYYMMDD>

8. change to the webserver directory ...
cd /ftp/pub/ot_release_<YYYYMMDD>

9. run the signing script ...
perl work/isign.pl

10. Change the softlink ...
cd /ftp/pub
rm -f ot
ln -s ot_release_<YYYYMMDD> ot

11. test it works ...
