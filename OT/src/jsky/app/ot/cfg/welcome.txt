Welcome to the Gemini Observing Tool Beta release.  Like the telescope
itself, this software is still under construction.  The Beta release
provides an opportunity for a select group of scientists and others to
get a feel for how the OT will work in order to help spot any major
flaws and guide its continuing development.

Not all features are present and many others are still being developed.
