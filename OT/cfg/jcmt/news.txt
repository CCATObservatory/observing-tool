JCMT Observing Tool

The JCMT-OT is released as part of the JAC Observation Management
Project. It has been extensively modified from the Gemini OT version 0.5.

+++ March 2007

  - Numerous changes to facilitate HARP observing.

  - Multi-subsystems are now available.

  - Special configurations for RxA and HARP have been added.

  - Changes to the Frequency Editor for multi-subsystems, it is now possible to lock to emmision lines for systems > 1.

  - Fixes to drawing in the Frequency Editor for better accuracy.

  - Changes to rasters for HARP, Sample spacing is fixed and Scan spacing options are reduced to a subset.

  - When changing between coordinate systems, positions get reset as they are currently not converted.

+++ October 2006 

  - Numerous changes to facilitate ACSIS Heterodyne observing.

  - The Raster eye now gives a guide to how large pixels are.

  - Tuning velocities can be specified separately from target radial velocities.

  - Grid patterns for Offset Iterators can append or overwrite positions.

  - Flat and Skydip eyes are no longer available.

  - Frequency and POL iterators are no longer available.

  - Relevatistic velocity frames are no longer available.

  - Frequency-Slow/Fast and None switching modes are no longer available.

  - All references to number of integerations have been removed.

  - When changing between coordinate systems, positions get reset as they are currently not converted.

  - Removal of SCUBA and DAS.

  - Fix for Guidestar Offsets in the Position Editor.

  - Fixes for cloning Telescope Positions within Survey Containers.

  - Fix some IO flushing problems.

  - Added name resolution for Orbital Elements via Horizons.

  - Line numbers added to Schema Validation.

  - Assorted fixes to Science Program Validation.

  - Upgrade to JSky 2.5 ( http://archive.eso.org/JSky/ )

  - It is no longer possible to accidently put sequences before components causing invalid XML to be produced.

  - Copying survey containers get properly cloned.

  - Changes to X-offsets to RA get applied as [ X-offset x cos( Dec ) ]

  - When targetting, the RA and Dec no longer get corrupted causing drift.

  - Initial removal of ODB and OM code.

  - Removal of SERVER options on the command line as part of ODB code removal.

  - XML Science Programs can now be opened from the command-line.

  - When opening files locally, the default working directory is the directory the user is in when the OT started.

  - Removal of OMP as an option as it is now the default, as a result the OT no longer supports SGML.

+++ February 2005

  [Semester 05A release - mainly for UKIRT]

  - Fixed problem with accurate display of offset Reference positions.

  - The Survey Container has been added.  This allows you to put multiple targets in
    the same container, and gives the Telescope Operator the choice if selecting n of
    the m targets.  It can either be placed at the top level of a Science Program
    (like an MSB), in which case it can contain at most 1 MSB (acting as a repeat
    iterator for the MSB), or within an MSB, when it can contain any number of 
    observations (acting as a target iterator).

  - MSB's marked as REMOVED can now be UNREMOVED and their count is maintained.
 
  - More than 1 observer note can now be specified, but they may not appear inside
    a sequence iterator.

  - Fixed a bug in prompting user to save.

+++ December 2003

  [Semester 04A release]

  - Time estimates now report both total time and time without calibrations
    (estimated time)

  - Validation is now performed against the TOML schema over the web (Note:
    Failure of validation does not indicate that submission will fail)

  - Improved layout on various components - now requires at least Java version
    1.4.1

  - On start-up, we now check to ensure that the correct version of Java is
    being used

  - On submission and retrieval to/from the database, pressing 'enter' after
    the password now behaves the same as pressing the "Commit" button.
