Swing version of Orac OT.

Some features off the new Swing OT differ from
those in the old FreeBongo OT:

  Copying components by dragging and dropping:    
    Press Control key during dragging.

  Changing background pattern:
    Not supported anymore.

  Frames:
    The Swing OT can be run with internal frames inside
    one main frame (like the old FreeBongo OT). This is the default
    behaviour.
    By using the flag -nointernalframes the OT displays every Science Program
    tree in a separate frame without one OT main frame.

    ONLY THE INTERNAL FRAMES MODE (DEFAULT) PROVIDES THE FULL FUNCTIONALITY
    OF THE OLD FREEBONGO VERSION!
