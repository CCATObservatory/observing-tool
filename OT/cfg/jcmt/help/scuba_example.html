Here we'll work through setting up a straightforward jiggle map observation.  If you need specific help on other modes, on choosing parameter values or on other science queries, try consulting our <a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/continuum/observing/ot_hints.html"> SCUBA Observing Tool FAQ</a>, or contact your Friend of Project. 

    <h2><a name="oe">Our example: preparing an 850/450 jiggle map</a></h2>

    Go to the JCMT root window, and open the SCUBA library:<p>

    <img src="images/filelibrary.gif" alt="Opening the SCUBA library"><p>

    A window will pop up containing a note and list of folders. The
    little switch on the left of the folder icons is an open/close
    toggle switch. Push open the folder titled "SCUBA MSBs" and then
    open the folder entitled "Jiggle Map MSBs".<!-- The results of those
      steps are illustrated below:--><p>

    <img src="images/library.gif" alt="Contents of the SCUBA library"><p>

      Inside the the "Jiggle Map MSBs" folder are a list of
      MSBs. Select the 850/450 MSB and click "Copy" on the toolbar.<p>

    <img src="images/copy.gif" alt="Copying an MSB"><p>

      Now go back to your Science Program window, and click on
      "Paste". The MSB will be dropped into your science
      program. Congratulations! You're now well underway. Now is a
      good time to save your progress, so use the File->Save option in
      your Science Program window and carry on.

    <h2><a name="ria">Really Important Aside - or is it Inside? </a></h2>

Do you see how the icon for the MSB is not directly below the icon for
the Science Program but indented to the right? That's because the MSB
is <em>inside</em> the Science Program. This is a classic way of
representing a hierarchical structure, and many of you will be
familiar with it from other applications, such as the "Manage
Bookmarks" screen in the Netscape and Mozilla browsers.


    <h2><a name="etmc">Editing the MSB  component</a></h2>

    <p> Click on the title of the MSB. This will activate the MSB
    editor panel on the right section of your window.<p>

    <img src="images/msb.gif" alt="MSB component editor"><p>

      The properties of an MSB are very simple. 

      <ul>

      <li>It has a title which you can change to something meaningful.
      <strong>Please</strong> take the time to do this - it
      really helps the person doing the observing.

      <li>A pull down menu with a repeat counter. Leave that to 1 for
      the time being.

      <li>The priority of the MSB. Note that this only affects the
      internal priority of your MSBs - not the priority allocated to
      your entire project by your TAG. So if you had two different
      MSBs that rose to the top of the scheduling queue and one had
      priority "1" and the other "99", the one marked "1" will
      normally get done first. If all your MSBs are of equal interest
      to you, just don't bother changing the default.

	<small>Small print: Bear in mind though that MSB selection is
	an operational decision - marking your MSBs with priorities 1,
	2, 3 etc is no guarantee that they will be done in precisely
	that particular order. For example, your lower-priority MSBs
	could be done because they are observable at a time of day
	where there is not much else in the queue, whereas your
	high-priority MSBs could be competing against the top-ranked
	project. Also, the observer/TSS may sometimes select a lower
	priority MSB because it is the most efficient choice at the
	time, because of its duration or azimuth.</small>

    </ul>

There are also two estimates of how long the MSB
will take. The first estimate is without any observations that you have marked as optional within the MSB, such as calibrations (more later).  The second includes absolutely every specified observation within the MSB.

<h2><a name="eoam">Elements of an MSB</a></h2>

    Click on the push lever to open up your MSB. Inside you will find
    a Site Quality component, a SCUBA component, two notes and two observation
    components (one calibration, one science):<p>

 <img src="images/elements.gif" alt="Inside an MSB"><p>

     We'll now go through these individually.


    <h2><a name="tsqc">The Site Quality component</a></h2>

    The Site Quality component specifies any weather-related
    scheduling requirements for an MSB. Click on the Site Quality
    component to get the Site Quality panel:<p>

    <img src="images/sitequality.gif" alt="Site Quality Component"><p>

     You probably don't need to change anything here. The default
     value of tau of "Allocated" means that your MSB can be scheduled
     when the tau is in the range that was specified by your TAG for
     your project. The default value of the sub-millimetre seeing is
     "Don't Care". If you think you need to change these values, click
     on the note entitled "Note: Site Quality" which contains a
     lengthy explanation.  DO NOT request a tau value outside your TAG allocation.
Your MSB will never be carried out if you do, since
the scheduling software requires firstly, that the current tau  
is within your TAG allocation and then, only once this condition 
has been met, that the current tau is within your range of personal preference.<p>
      


    <h2><a name="tsc">The SCUBA component</a></h2>

    The SCUBA component specifies SCUBA's configuration for this
    MSB. Click on the SCUBA component to get the JCMT SCUBA panel:<p>

    <img src="images/scuba.gif" alt="Scuba Component"><p>

    You probably don't need to change anything here. Since you started
    out by copying a 450/850 jiggle map out of the library it is
    already set to use the 450W/850W array. Just note that this is the
    place where you can specify which filter and which array or
    bolometer to use.

    <h2><a name="tsc">Notes: a vital step for good observations</a></h2>

    The other elements before the observations are two notes.  When you bring the MSB from the library, these notes contain information intended for you, the PI.  At the end of this example, we'll explain more about using notes to give information to the TSS (see <a href="#notes">The only good observer is an informed observer</a>).  For now we'll just point out that this is the place to put a note which you wish to have apply to the observations in a single  MSB, and that you can just convert one of these notes into one for TSSs by ticking the "Show to Observer" option (and replacing the text, of course).

    

    <h2><a name="tfoc">The first observation: Calibration</a></h2>

    Now click on the first observation to bring up its panel<p>
 
    <img src="images/calibration.gif" alt="Calibration Observation"><p>

    The properties of an observation are quite simple. It has a name
    and also an estimate of that observation's duration. The tickbox
    marked "Flag as calibration" is fairly self-explanatory but has
      some important implications. When this box is ticked it means:

<ul>

      <li>The observation is exempt from having a specific
      target. Instead the TSS may choose a source at their
	discretion, for example by picking high elevation JCMT
	calibrator in the right quadrant.<p>


      <li>The observation may be deferred till later, at the
      discretion of the TSS, if a calibrator is not available but will
	rise later in the night. <p>


      <li>The observation is optional. This means that the TSS may
      skip it at his discretion if an appropriate calibration was
      recently taken. See <a href="#redundancy">My MSBs only last half
	  an hour so it is a waste to do a calibration for each one!</a><p>


	  <li>The time estimate for this observation is not included in the "w/o optionals" estimate on the program and MSB front pages.<p>
	
      <li>Depending on your national queue's accounting procedures,
      your project may not be ultimately charged with some or all of
      the time spent observing the calibrator.<p>


</ul>

    <h2><a name="ts">The sequence</a></h2>

Push the toggle on the left of the calibration observation to open it
up:<p>

      <img src="images/sequence.gif" alt="The sequence iterator"><p>

      Lots of stuff here, but no need to panic. First, there is
      another note, since we do try and make our library MSBs
      self-documenting. If you actually want to use this or any other
      of our library MSBs for real make sure you read all the notes! 
      After the note there is what we call a sequence iterator (more
      about this below in <a href="#thingies">Components, Iterators
      And All That</a>) The sequence iterator doesn't do anything per
      se, so you can ignore it for the moment, but it is important to
      note that it represents the sequence of events at the
      telescope.<p>

Inside it are a chop iterator and 4 "eyes". Eyes?? Time for another
aside.

<h2><a name="thingies">Components, Iterators And All That</a></h2>

We've talked about several things so far, so it's time to have a quick
run down. <p>

<ul>

      <li> <img src="images/icon_msb.gif" alt="*">MSBs
      <strong>are</strong> individually schedulable blocks and
      <strong>contain</strong> one or more fully specified science
      observation and any calibrations.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_observation.gif" alt="*">Observations
      <strong>are</strong> observations of a single astronomical
	target and <strong>contain</strong> components and a sequence.<p>



      <li><img src="images/icon_component.gif" alt="*">Components
      <strong>are</strong> configurators for the JCMT systems such as
      the instrument (SCUBA component), the telescope (Target
      component) and the scheduler (Site Quality component). <p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_iterator.gif" alt="*">Iterators
      <strong>are</strong> potentially multiple actions and
      <strong>contain</strong> other iterators and one or more
      eyes.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_eye.gif" alt="*">Eyes
      <strong>are</strong> actions that results in the actual taking
      of data - a single data file per eye to be precise.<p>


      <li><img src="images/icon_note.gif" alt="*">Notes
      <strong>are</strong> a repository of useful information and can
      go anywhere.<p>

</ul>

    <h2><a name="eyes">The Eyes have it</a></h2>

Now look at that Sequence again. What we have is the classic SCUBA
calibration sequence - a skydip, followed by a pointing, a focus and a jiggle map. How many data files will result
    from this sequence? Four eyes - four data files.<p>

By clicking on the various eyes you can see their properties but you
don't need to change any of those now. 

    <h2><a name="tci">The chop iterator</a></h2>

    Click on the chop iterator:<p>


    <img src="images/chop.gif" alt="The Chop Iterator"><p>

      The chop iterator has a list of chop configurations (in this
      example only one 120 arcsecond chop, but for scan maps there are
      typically six). Each chop needs to be specified by a throw, an
      angle, and co-ordinate frame of the angle. In this example the
      frame is AZEL (Azimuth Elevation) but other common options are
      TRACKING (RA & Dec) or FPLANE (Focal Plane, ie Nasmyth for
      SCUBA).<p>

    <h2><a name="tje">The Jiggle eye</a></h2>

    No need to edit any properties here, but you might note that since
    the Jiggle eye is <strong>inside</strong> the chop iterator (see
    how it is indented?), the chop action will apply to it. So, your
    jiggle observation will be have a 120 arcsecond, 90 degree AZEL
    chop as specified in the chop iterator. More about how placement
    affects properties in <a href="#placement">A Note About
    Placement</a><p>


    <h2><a name="tso">The science observation</a></h2>

    Now expand your science target - nothing you haven't seen before
    except for the Target component and the Repeat iterator which
    we'll cover next. Meanwhile, take this opportunity to give your
    observation a sensible name and to save your progress.

    <h2><a name="tcc">The target component</a></h2>

    Click on the target component to bring up its panel:<p>
    
   <img src="images/target.gif" alt="The Target component"><p>

      At first glance you might thing that what you have to do here is
      enter your target name and position and you can certainly do
      that. However you can do even less than that - if you are using
      a machine with an Internet connection try just entering the name
      of your target (in our example the IRAS source 18592+0108) and
      hit "Resolve Name".<p>

      After a brief pause the RA and DEC co-ordinate fields are
      populated with the SIMBAD co-ordinates for the source. The
      SIMBAD name for the source will also be indicated next to the
      "Resolve Name" button.  And of course, double check that the
      co-ordinates are those you intend to observe. <p>

<!--      N.B. Not all ACSII characters are allowed in the target name -
      make sure your target name is built up of only the following
      characters A-Z, a-z 0-9,+,- and _. <p>-->

      But wait - that's not all.<p>

    <h2><a name="tpe">The position editor</a></h2>

    You can skip this section if you want because you don't have to do
    anything, but it's kind of cool and can be very useful in picking
    a good chop position. Click on the plot button at the bottom left
    of the target panel:<p>

   <img src="images/plot.gif" alt="Plotting a position"><p>

      A whole new window will pop up - this is the position
      editor. Looks a bit boring at the moment though, with just a
      small green crosshair in the middle. Let's make it a bit more
      interesting - go to Catalog menu and into the Image Servers item
      and chose a Digital Sky Survey near near you:<p>

   <img src="images/tpe.gif" alt="The Position editor"><p>

      It's now full of stars. The display application, by the way, is
      is based on JSky, for those familiar with it. <p>

      If you're having problems with the position editor, the most likely explanation is that your version(s) of JRE, JAI and/or java may not be sufficiently up-to-date; check the <a href="download.html">download page</a> for more information.  If you are behind a firewall, you may need to check your <a href="advanced.html#proxy">proxy server settings</a>.<p>

      The DSS may not be the most useful survey for planning
      sub-millimetre observations, but you can read in any FITS image
      with an appropriate WCS header using Open under the File
      menu. You can also fetch a FITS image over the Web.

      In the screenshot below I have loaded the SCUBA commissioning
      scan map of W48 <em>(image courtesy Tim Jenness)</em>. If you
      have an Internet connection, go to the File menu, select "Open
      URL...:" and type in the following URL: <a
      href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/software/jcmtot/w48.fits">http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/software/jcmtot/w48.fits</a>
      or download the image by clicking on the link and and use
      File-&gt;Open to read it in. Notice that the RA/DEC position
      fields of the target component must be set reasonably near to
      the world co-ordinate of the FITS file otherwise the image may
      not load properly. <p>

      <img src="images/w48.gif" alt="W48"><p>

      You will then see the DSS image replaced with the sub-millimetre
      image.<p>

      <blockquote>
      <small>A short technical note if you are planning on generating your own
      image for import: if you want to import a SCUBA map in NDF format,
      convert it to FITS by using the <a
      href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk">Starlink</a> <a
      href="http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/star/docs/sun55.htx/sun55.html"><tt>convert</tt></a>
      utility with the following arguments:

<pre>ndf2fits encoding=FITS-IRAF bitpix=32 comp=D</pre>

    If you have difficulty despite doing this, let us know.</small></blockquote>

    <p>As I mentioned before, the green cross-hair is the position of
    your science co-ordinates. Click on the button on the left side of
    the position editor entitled "Sci Area". The circle that is drawn
    is the SCUBA field of view.<p>

    Now for the useful thing I mentioned earlier. While leaving the
    position editor window open, go back to your science program
    window and click on your chop iterator that is inside your science
    observation. Now look at the position editor. The chop beams and
    the area in which they will rotate during integration are
    drawn. Well, that's no good - we're chopping onto bright stuff! 
    <p>


    This is where the position editor comes into its own. We are going
    to use it to specify where exactly we would like to chop. In the
    chop iterator, use the drop down menu to change the chopping
    co-ordinate frame from AZEL to TRACKING (i.e. RA/DEC). You will
    notice that in the position editor the uncertainty circles have
    disappeared, since we will always chop in the same position in the
    sky:<p>

      <img src="images/tpe_chop.gif" alt="Chop and the Position Editor"><p>
	   
 Now back in the position editor, click on the Drag button on the
 upper left side of the window. The click on the centre of one of the
	   chop beams in the display and drag it away from the emission:<p>

      <img src="images/tpe_chop2.gif" alt="Dragging the Chop"><p>

      You will note that the values in the chop iterator have
      automatically changed to reflect the new chop throw and angle
      values. Neat, eh? If you are going to do this for real and have
      a calibration observation in the same MSB, don't forget that the
      chop in your calibration observation should be the same, so you
      should update the calibration chop iterator with whatever values
      you decided on for your science calibration.<p>

      You can also click on the target component and use Drag to
      change your science co-ordinates if you wish. 


    <h2><a name="time">The repeat iterator and integration time in general</a></h2>

    Back to your Sciece Program window now. Click on the Repeat
    iterator. It's only property is a repeat counter:<p>

      <img src="images/repeat.gif" alt="The Repeat Iterator"><p>

      The repeat iterator acts on things that are
      <strong>inside</strong> the repeat iterator (i.e. indented under
      it) in turn. So if you set it to 2, your science observation
      consists of a pointing followed by two jiggle maps. How many
      data files will this result in? Three! <p>

      Now you can see how your time usage builds up. Working our way
      inside out (and bottom to top): <p>

<ul>
      <li><img src="images/icon_eye.gif" alt="*"> The Jiggle eye can be set to a number of integrations (and
      shows you the estimated RMS noise) that will result from the
      number of integrations in that single Jiggle<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_iterator.gif" alt="*">The Repeat
      iterator multiplies the number of times the Jiggle is carried
      out. If you increase it from the default of 1, don't forget to
      take that into account when calculating how deep you will go.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_component.gif" alt="*">The observation
      component shows you the estimated time of the sequence it
      contains. In our example this includes the time of the pointing
      plus the time of the jiggle repeated twice.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_msb.gif" alt="*">The MSB component
      will give you the estimated time of the observations inside it -
      in this case the science observation plus the calibration
      observation. Let's be clear: this is the estimated time of that
      single MSB.<p>

      <li><img src="images/sci_prog.gif" alt="*">The Science Program will give you the estimated time of all
      MSBs inside it including the number of repeats. So if you have a
      1hr MSB (as in this example) and you set the MSB counter to 2,
      your MSB estimated time will be 1hr and your Science Program
      time will show 2hrs.

</ul>

    I hope that makes sense.


    <h2><a name="notes">The only good observer is an informed observer</h2>

As you can see from the library we have insterted informative notes
    for detailed observation. But this works both ways -<strong> you</strong> should also
make a note containing information that will be useful to the observer
taking your data! This note should describe the aim of the
    observations and adress observational concerns such as:<p>


<ul>

  <li> "Stable weather is critical for this project, tau is less important
    i.e. can be done when weather is on the edge of the allocated band."

  <li> "Pointing and focus are critical for this project. Please repeat
  any pointings with shifts in excess of 2 arcseconds.  Please repeat
  the Z-focus at least once every two hours and the X-, and Y-focus at
  least at the start and middle of the shift."

<li> "Precise calibration is/is not exremely important for this project."

</ul>

If you wish to make a single note that pertains to all your MSBs,
highlight the title of your science programme and click on "Note" on
the left toolbar.  A note will be dropped in just below your
    highlight.  Alternatively you can convert one of the notes with information for PIs, as explained above.<p>


      <img src="images/note.gif" alt="Inserting a note"><p>

You may then click on the note itself, which allows you to tick the
"Show to observer" option and enter your comments. Notes which are available to observers will appear in a dark blue colour in your science program window.  You can also then specify useful information like required S/N, which may help observers to avoid wasting time on your observations by going too deep.<p>

      <img src="images/note2.gif" alt="Show note to observer"><p>

If you prefer, you can also put in an individual note in each MSB. If
there is a "Show to observer" note inside an MSB, as well as a "Show to observer" note higher up in the hierarchy, the two will be concatenated in the observer's display.  Hence you could, if you wished, put a general note beneath the program title and then a specific note within each MSB - both will be visible.<p>
