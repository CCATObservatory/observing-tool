<h2><a name="het_anat">Guided Tour of an Example MSB (Beam-Switched 
Sample) </a> </h2>

    Go to the JCMT root window, and open the ACSIS library by clicking on 
:<p>

   <img src="het_images/het_library.gif" alt="Contents of the
		heterodyne library"><p>

       A window will pop up containing a list of folders. The
    little switch on the left of the folder icons is an open/close
    toggle switch. Push open the folder titled "Samples" and then
    select the MSB labeled "Beam-switch sample(1X) " and click "Copy" on 
the toolbar.<p>

    <img src="het_images/het_copy.gif" alt="Copying an MSB" ><p>

      Now go back to your Science Program window, and click on
      "Paste". The MSB will be dropped into your science
      program. Congratulations! You're now well underway. Now is a
      good time to save your progress, so use the File->Save option in
      your Science Program window and carry on. <!-- 
############################################################################ 
-->

    <h2><a name="ria">Really Important Aside - or is it Inside? </a></h2>

Do you see how the icon for the MSB is not directly below the icon for the 
Science Program but indented to the right? That's because the MSB is 
<em>inside</em> the Science Program. This is a classic way of representing 
a hierarchical structure, and many of you will be familiar with it from 
other applications, such as the "Manage Bookmarks" screen in the Netscape 
and Mozilla browsers.


    <h2><a name="het_etmc">Editing the MSB component</a></h2>

    <p> Click on the title of the MSB. This will activate the MSB
    editor panel on the right section of your window.<p>


      The properties of an MSB are very simple.

      <ul>

      <li>It has a title, at the moment "Beam-switch sample".  When
 preparing your own MSB, this title should be changed to something
 meaningful describing the observation, usually with target
 name. Examples might be "B/SW observation of OMC1" or "3 point grid
 of M83". <strong>Please</strong> take the time to do this - it
      really helps the person doing the observing.

      <li>A pull down menu with a repeat counter. Leave that to 1 for
      the time being.

      <li>The priority of the MSB. Note that this only affects the
      internal priority of your MSBs - not the priority allocated to
      your entire project by your TAG. So if you had two different
      MSBs that rose to the top of the scheduling queue and one had
      priority "1" and the other "99", the one marked "1" will
      normally get done first. If all your MSBs are of equal interest
      to you, just don't bother changing the default.

	<small>Small print: Bear in mind though that MSB selection is
	an operational decision - marking your MSBs with priorities 1,
	2, 3 etc is no guarantee that they will be done in precisely
	that particular order. For example, your lower-priority MSBs
	could be done because they are observable at a time of day
	where there is not much else in the queue, whereas your
	high-priority MSBs could be competing against the top-ranked
	project. Also, the observer/TSS may sometimes select a lower
	priority MSB because it is the most efficient choice at the
	time, because of its duration or azimuth.</small>

    </ul>

There is also a display of the OT's estimate of how long the MSB will 
take.

    component which is labelled "Observation":<p>

    <h2><a name="het_thsc">The Het Setup component</a></h2>
 
<p> If you click on the "Het Setup" component you will see the 
    window below. The purpose of
	  this component is to enable the configuration of the required
	  heterodyne instrument (the Front End) and ACSIS (the 'back 
          end') prior to an observation. </p>
 

<img src="het_images/het_het_setup.gif" alt="Het Setup component" ><p>
Four boxes are displayed in the editor panel.

<h3>Front End Configuration</h3>
<ul>





<li> The first item in the Het Setup component enables the user to
		choose the required receiver or <b>Front End</b>. The 
                tuning/frequency range over which the
		selected receiver can be tuned is displayed in the
		<b>Front End Summary</b> box in the top-right corner.

<li> The <b>Sp.(ectral) regions</b> box allows the selection of multiple 
     spectral windows. These may be selected from among a list of
     favourite combinations in the <b>Special Config(uration)s</b>
     pull-down menu to the right, or defined interactively using
     the <b>Frequency Editor</b> (see below). The Frequency editor tool is
     shown and hidden using the buttons further down the window.  

<li> The <b>Bandwidths</b> menu item allows the selection of the 
     required bandwidth (in MHz) for each Spectral Region. The resulting 
     spectral resolution
		(in kHz) is shown automatically updated in the "res"
		entry in the Frequency Configuration table at the
		bottom of the Het Setup menu.



<li> The <b>Mode</b> box allows a choice between double sideband
		(dsb) and single sideband (ssb) operation. Note that
		receiver A has no single sideband capabilities, so
		"dsb" is the only allowed option.
 
<li> The <b>Sideband</b> menu allows the choice of sideband. 
		Sideband suppression is not absolute
		in the SSB receivers, so the user should avoid, if
		possible, the situation where the unwanted sideband
		corresponds to a frequency where the zenith opacity or
		receiver noise is high. In most cases, however, you
	    could simply select "Best".

</ul>

<h3>Frequency Setup</h3>

<p>Tuning of the receiver requires a rest frequency and a velocity.
   If the aim is to observe a specific molecular transition the 
   user may use the pull-down lists of <b>molecules</b> and 
   <b>transitions</b> to generate the frequency. The example above shows 
   the <b>CO J=2-1</b> combination (230.538 GHz).
   Alternately, the tuning frequency may be specified explicitly
   in GHz. The frequency will appear in 
   <font color=red><b>RED</b></font> until the <b>Accept</b> button 
   is clicked. <i>This is essential to ensure acceptance of the input</i>. 
   This method will also result in the phrase 'No line' appearing in the 
   molecule and transition fields, even if the frequency does in fact 
   correspond to a 
   known transition. (Look-up occurs from molecule/transition to
   frequency only - no look-up is done in the opposite direction).

<p>The velocity of the target may be entered either here or in the 
   <a href="#het_tcc">Target Information</a> component; this second option 
   is activated by ticking the box marked 
   <b>Default tuning velocity to target velocity</b>.
   If entering the velocity here you must also specify the  
   <b>Velocity Definition</b> and <b>Velocity Frame</b> from the two 
pull-down menus, 
   and click the "Accept" button (to the right of the frequency field).
  (Note that the velocity will appear in 
   <font color=red><b>RED</b></font> until you click on the Accept button.  
   Failure to click on the Accept button will mean the velocity you 
   entered will be lost.)  

	    
<p><ul>
   <li>If your source has a very large radial velocity, you should:
<ul><li> Select the receiver within whose tuning range the
	    (redshifted) line will fall.  For example, at a redshift of
	    2.0, the neutral carbon [CI]
	    J=2-1 line, whose rest frequency is 809 GHz, will fall
	    into the tuning range of RxA. 
<li> Specify the radial velocity of the source, as above, either in the
	    <i>Het. Setup</i> velocity field, or in the <i>Target
	      Info.</i> velocity field.  (If you choose the latter,
	    make sure the Target Info. component is on the same level
	    as the Het. Setup component, and not embedded in the
	    observation sequence.)  If you enter the velocity in the
	    <i>Het. Setup</i> 
	    component, be sure to click the Accept button before proceeding.
<li> The OT now corrects its lookup table of transitions for the 
            entered velocity.
	    Select a molecule and transition
	    from the pull-down menu, or enter the <b>rest</b> frequency of the
	    spectral line (and click the Accept button).  Beware,
	    however, that if you enter a   
	    value manually into the frequency field, the OT will not
	    check to see if the redshifted line is in the tuning range
	    of the receiver you selected.  
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<h3><a name="het_freq_ed"></a>Frequency Editor</h3>


<p>Clicking on the Frequency Editor button will show you something 
like this:
<p>
<img src="het_images/het_frequency_editor.gif" alt="Het Freq Editor">
<p>
<p>
 The frequency editor tool is particular useful when it comes to receivers 
operating in double sideband mode, where two differing sky frequencies end 
up with the same IF frequency. In this case, identifying spectral lines 
can be tricky since one does not know,  a priori, which sideband they are 
from.
 This tool now handles multi-spectral window selections and 
 can be used interactively in choosing observing frequencies 
 and bandwidths, particularly where you might want to observe several
 lines at once in one window with DSB receivers, or when using 
 <a href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/spectral_line/Backends/DAS/das_nonstandard.txt">
 special ACSIS configurations</a>, 
 or simply to check the atmospheric opacity at
 the observed (or sideband) frequency.  
 
<p>
Working roughly from top to bottom, left to right, in the example above 
showing only one Spectral Subsystem we see:
<br>
<ul>
<li>the observing and image side-bands, marked as <b>LSB</b> and 
    <b>USB</b>
<li>their locations within the respective LO2 ranges and their widths 
<li>the identification of the selected emission line, marked <b>Line</b>
<li>the <b>IF</b> (Intermediate Frequency), sometimes in Hz sometimes GHz
<li>the bandwidth, in MHz
<li>the <b>Res</b>olution that the selected bandwidth produces, in kHz
<li>the molecular transitions in this vicinity, marked by vertical bars,
     on a line labelled <b>Emission Lines</b>
<li>the frequency scale immediately below Emission Lines is the FE 
frequency, doppler shifted by the velocity value and definition entered in 
the het-setup component. You will notice this scale will shift if you enter a 
non-zero velocity, and will also shift if you change the velocity 
definition.
<li>the line selected is shown in <font color=red>red</font> 
<li>the receiver temperature (<font color=red>TRx</font>) is plotted as 
    the >font color=red>red</font> line (although there 
     is no scale currently). It's wise to
	  check this since even a minor change in radial velocity can
	  shift the observed frequency into a region of very large
	  atmospheric opacity.
<li>the <b>FE Freq</b>uency scale, shown below the plot of TRx
    is the observing frequency in the rest frame of the receiver
<li>the Local Oscillator frequency, shown as <b>LO1</b>, located within 
the full tuning range of the receiver.
<ul>
<li>Note the upper frequency scale, lower frequency scale and LO1 are only 
approximate because the correction from the receiver rest frame to the 
chosen rest frame requires the Doppler correction for the Earth's 
motion, which varies with time.
</ul>
</ul>
Among the dynamic functions, we find that
<ul>
<li>the positions of the windows can be changed by 
clicking on the window sliders and dragging . . . Note how the LO1 
and LO2 (ie the IF) both change
<li>the bandwidth can be changed by clicking on the pull-down menu
<li>clicking anywhere along the 'Emission lines' level will identify 
the nearby lines.
<li>keeping the mouse button depressed while scrolling 
down through the menu makes the line appear in 
<font color=green>green</font>
<li>The LO1 frequency can be changed by right-clicking on the slider and 
dragging. This changes both frequency scales and the line rest frequency. 
Moving the LO slider can be a convenient means of choosing a band centre 
frequency such that particular spectral lines are included or excluded 
from your passband. 
</ul> 
<p> 
To generate a multi-line, multi-Subsystem configuration: 
<ul>
<li>In the Front-End configuration window, select a value of Sp.(ectral) 
regions greater than 1.
 The Frequency Configuration block at the bottom of the screen will show 
 the appropriate number of 'Region's, although initially they
 are populated with default values. 
<li>Select the first line (for Region 0) as above. 
<li>Press the Frequency Editor button to generate a Frequency Editor 
    window with the appropriate number of Subsystems. The pre-selected 
    line is in <font color=red>red</font>.
<li><b>Click</b> at the level of 'Emission Lines' in the general vicinity
    (frequency space) of the next desired line
<li>keep the button pressed and scroll down until the line is met,
    and shown in <font color=green>green</font>
<li>click on the sideband window and drag the window over the 
    green line
<li>click on the 'Line' box appropriate for that subsystem to transfer the
    line identity
<li>Repeat (from <b>Click</b>) for further lines if necessary
<li>Press the Hide Frequency Editor button to transfer these data to the
    Heterodyne Setup window
</ul>

Note that the movement of the sliders will make for 
configurations that may not be easily repeatable.
If you have a multi-line configuration that you consider 
astrophysically important - and which may be useful for either
yourself or others later on - please contact the JCMT staff
and request that it become one of the available 'Special 
Config(uration)s'. Our (<a href="http://cadcwww.hia.nrc.ca/">CADC</a>) 
database will then be a lot simpler to manage and search if everyone
using this combination of lines uses precisely the same configuration.

    <h2><a name="het_tsc">Site Quality</a></h2>
 
    The Site Quality component specifies any weather-related
    scheduling requirements for an MSB. Click on the Site Quality
    component to get the Site Quality panel:<p>

    <img src="het_images/het_site_quality.gif" alt="Site Quality 
Component" ><p>

     Your TAG normally allocates your program a certain range of tau 
(opacity), so you probably don't need to change anything here unless your 
program is using multiple receivers and the TAG-allocated tau range is not 
sufficiently specific for this MSB. You should specify an appropriate 
range of tau to match the demands of the receiver to be used. But 
<blink>beware</blink>: 
the resulting range of tau in which the MSB can be observed is then the 
intersect of the TAG allocation and your input: make sure this is not an 
empty set ! For example, if the TAG allocation for your project is
	  weather band 4 (tau(225GHz) between 0.12 and 0.2) and you
	  request a tau range between 0.1 and 0.12, then your project
	  will be picked up for observation ONLY if the tau is EXACTLY
	  0.12.

<p> The default value of the sub-millimetre seeing is "Don't 
Care".

<p>It is useful to set the "&tau; for noise calculation" value,
	  however, to the <i>average</i> or <i>expected</i> value of
	  tau during which your observations are expected to be
	  obtained.  (Note that the OT <i>does not know</i> what &tau;
	  range was allocated for your project.)  The OT uses the
	  value in this field to calculate the estimated RMS of the
	  observation specified in the phot/sam etc. "eye"-cons.


<!-- 
############################################################################ 
-->
    <h2><a name="het_tsched">Scheduling Constraints</a></h2>
 
<p> The Scheduling Constraints component allows one to restrict or
	    broaden the time over which an MSB will be selected. To
	    insert this component, click on the <i>Component</i>
	    button on the left side near the bottom of the OT window,
	    and select the "Sched. Constraints".  <p>

    <img src="het_images/het_sched_constraints.gif" alt="Scheduling
		Constraints Component" > <p> 

              The main reason you might want to insert this component
              is if your science targets have a very low or very high
              declination (i.e. &delta; &lt; ~-35<sup>o</sup> or
              &delta; &gt; ~+80<sup>o</sup>). By default, MSBs are
              only selected when the sources are above about
              30<sup>o</sup> elevation, so low- and high- declination
              sources may never be selected unless you specify a lower
              minimum elevation.  Similarly, sources at
              ~19<sup>o</sup> declination transit almost directly
              overhead, and you may wish to restrict such sources to
              be selected when they're not at extremely high
              elevations.

<p>Another reason to insert this component is if your observations are
	      time-critical, i.e. they must not be done before a
	      certain date or after a certain date.  This can be
	      specified by changing the Earliest and/or Latest
	      Schedule Date.

<p>You may also need to use this component if you have a project which
	      requires periodic observations, for example if you were
	      monitoring a variable source.  In that case, you can
	      specify the repeat time in the "Reschedule every..." box.
              The MSB will be reactivated at the appropriate time.

<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_tfoc">The Observation component</a></h2>

    Now click on the Observation component to bring up its panel. If you 
recursively open all of the toggle switches, the individual components 
will be displayed as a hierarchy, as shown below.<p>
 
    <img src="het_images/obs_comp.gif" alt="Observation component" ><p>

The first element inside the Observation component can be the "Target
information" component. Note, however, that in the templates the
target component is outside the Observation component. This allows one
to construct an MSB to perform multiple observations on a single
target: such MSBs would therefore contain multiple Observation
components. More importantly for heterodyne observations it allows the
Het. Component to access velocity information that may need to be
obtained from the Target Component.  Further details on this issue of
component nesting may be found in the section on <a
href="./advanced.html">advanced topics</a>.  Following the Target
component in the example is a sequence iterator which contains a
repeat iterator, then (depending upon the observation type) perhaps a
chop iterator or an offset iterator - a position-switched raster
centred on the Target, as in this example, needs neither - and then,
finally, a single (action) "eye".  The sequence iterator doesn't do
anything <i>per se</i>, but it is important to note that it represents
the sequence of events at the telescope. The repeat iterator allows
the user to control the number of repeats carried out for a certain
observation. The "eye"-con represents the observation itself.

<p>
The "Flag as calibration" button should be toggled ON if, indeed,
this observation is intended as a calibration for others.
This fact is then made known to the TSS who may decide not to 
execute the observation (er . . calibration) if a suitable
calibration has recently been done already.

<!-- 
############################################################################ 
-->
    <h2><a name="het_tcc">The target component</a></h2>

    Click on the target component to bring up its panel:<p>
    
   <img src="het_images/het_target.gif" alt="The Target component" ><p>

<p>In this component you will enter the coordinates and velocity of
	      the source, and the coordinates of the reference
	      position (for position-switched observations).

<p>The "Target Type" is a pull-down menu that allows you to select
	      RA/Dec (most common), Orbital Elements (for comets,
	      etc.), or a Named Planet.  The window changes for each
	      selection.

<p>For RA/Dec targets, enter the R.A. and Dec. in the appropriate
	      boxes, using colons as separators.  One of several
	      different coordinate systems can be selected with
	      another pull-down menu, such as J2000, B1950, etc.  

<p>It is now necessary to specify the radial velocity of the source in
	      the target component, either as a radio, optical, or
	      relativistic velocity, or redshift (z).  Note that if
	  the velocity was specified in the <a href="#het_thsc">Het. Setup</a>
	  component, it may not be necessary to specify the velocity here.

<p>To specify a reference position, click on "REFERENCE".  The default
	      is to enter the offset (in arcseconds) from the source
	      position, but by unchecking the "Offset" button, you can
	      enter an absolute position for the reference.

      
<p>Instead of entering the source coordinates manually, you can
download it from the Web. If you are using a machine with an Internet
connection you can enter the name of your target, select the on-line
catalogue to search (i.e. SIMBAD or NED) from the pull-down menu, and
hit "Resolve Name". After a brief pause the RA and DEC co-ordinate
fields should become populated with the SIMBAD/NED co-ordinates for
the source. The SIMBAD/NED name for the source will also be indicated
next to the "Resolve Name" button. <p>
       
<p><blink><font color=red>WARNING</red></font></blink>: Positions of
astronomical objects are often wavelength dependent. For example, the 
SIMBAD coordinates for 
IRAS16293-2224 are many arcminutes
different from the JCMT coordinates.  The catalogues you may be using
will have defined the astrometric positions therein on the basis of
optical- or infrared- or radio- observations. You should check that
the positions now showing are valid for your submillimetre studies.<p>

<!-- N.B. Not all ACSII characters are allowed in the target name -
      make sure your target name is built up of only the following
      characters A-Z, a-z 0-9,+,- and _. -->


      But wait - that's not all.<p> <!--

    <h2><a name="het_tpe">The position editor</a></h2>

    You can <a href="#het_tci">skip</a> this section if you want because 
you don't have to do
    anything, but it's kind of cool and can be very useful in picking
    a good chop position. Click on the plot button at the bottom left
    of the target panel:<p>

      A whole new window will pop up - this is the position
      editor. Looks a bit boring at the moment though, with just a
      small green crosshair in the middle. Let's make it a bit more
      interesting - go to Catalog menu and into the Image Servers item
      and chose a Digital Sky Survey near near you:<p>

   <img src="het_images/het_tpe.gif" alt="The Position editor"><p>

      It's now full of stars. The display application, by the way, is
      is based on JSky, for those familiar with it. <p>

      If you're having problems with the position editor, the most likely 
explanation is that your version(s) of JRE, JAI and/or java may not be 
sufficiently up-to-date; check the <a href="download.html">download 
page</a> for more information.  If you are behind a firewall, you may need 
to check your <a href="advanced.html#proxy">proxy server settings</a>.<p>

      The DSS may not be the most useful survey for planning
      sub-millimetre observations, but you can read in any FITS image
      with an appropriate WCS header using Open under the File
      menu. You can also fetch a FITS image over the Web.

      The screenshot below shows the SCUBA commissioning
      scan map of W48 <em>(image courtesy Tim Jenness)</em>. If you
      have an Internet connection, go to the File menu, select "Open

      or download the image by clicking on the link and and use
      File-&gt;Open to read it in. Notice that the RA/DEC position
      fields of the target component must be set reasonably near to
      the world co-ordinate of the FITS file otherwise the image may
      not load properly.<p>

      <img src="images/w48.gif" alt="W48"><p>

      You will then see the DSS image replaced with the sub-millimetre

    <p>As was mentioned before, the green cross-hair is the position of
    your science co-ordinates. Click on the button on the left side of
    the position editor entitled "Sci Area". The circle that is drawn
    is the HPBW of the chosen heterodyne receiver.<p>

    Now for the useful thing mentioned earlier: While leaving the
    position editor window open, go back to your science program
    window and click on your chop iterator that is inside your science
    observation. Now look at the position editor. The chop beams and
    the area in which they will rotate during integration are
    drawn. Well, that's no good - we're chopping onto bright stuff!
    <p>

 <img src="het_images/het_bright_chop.gif" alt="bright stuff"><p>

    This is where the position editor comes into its own. We are going
    to use it to specify where exactly we would like to chop. In the
    chop iterator, use the drop down menu to change the chopping
    co-ordinate frame from AZEL to TRACKING (i.e. RA/DEC). You will
    notice that in the position editor the uncertainty circles have
    disappeared, since we will always chop in the same position in the
    sky:<p>

      <img src="het_images/het_tracking_chop.gif" alt="Chop and the 
Position Editor"><p>
	   
 Now back in the position editor, click on the Drag button on the
 upper left side of the window. Then click on the centre of one of the
	   chop beams in the display and drag it away from the 
emission:<p>

      <img src="het_images/het_tracking_chop2.gif" alt="Dragging the 
Chop"><p>

      You will note that the values in the chop iterator have
      automatically changed to reflect the new chop throw and angle
      values. Neat, eh? Remember that by default, any calibrations for
      your observations will be performed with the same chop as the
      science observation. <p>

      You can also click on the target component and use Drag to
      change your science co-ordinates if you wish. <!--

    <h2><a name="het_tci">The chop iterator</a></h2>

    Click on the chop iterator:<p>


    <img src="het_images/het_chop.gif" alt="The Chop Iterator" ><p>

      The chop iterator has a list of chop configurations (in this
      example only one 60 arcsecond chop). Each chop needs to be
	      specified by a throw,
      an angle, and co-ordinate frame of the angle. In this example
      the frame is AZEL (Azimuth Elevation) but other common options
      are TRACKING (RA & Dec) or FPLANE (Focal Plane). A 60 arcsecond
	  chop with an angle of 90 degrees AZEL
      (i.e. 60 arcsec in the azimuth direction) is typical for
      beamswitched observations of compact sources. If the source is
      extended, one might want to increase the chop throw, or if the
      source was elongated in one direction on the sky, chop in a rotated
      direction relative 
      to the RA/DEC frame. The maximum recommended chop throw is 180 arcsec.
      There is a software limit of 240 arcsec. Chopping with large throws
      is less efficient than using small throws and also there will be
      a slight distortion of the beam due to observing off-axis. 
      Clicking on Add one can add chop configurations. Each configuration
      will result in a separate observation (and data file).

<h2><a name="het_offset">The offset iterator</a></h2>

<p>It's often very useful to be able to specify a position with the <a
href="#het_tcc">Target component</a>, but to take an observation at a
position offset from that specified.  That can be done with the
"offset" iterator.  In addition, with <a href="#het_grid_folder">Grid
maps</a>, a whole series of offsets can be specified in either a
regular or irregular spacing.<p>

<img src="het_images/het_offset1.gif" alt="The Offset Iterator (1)" ><p>

If an offset iterator is not already specified in the MSB, one can
insert it below the Sequence iterator <img
src="images/icon_iterator.gif" alt="*">, usually just above the
photom/sample "eye"-con <img src="images/icon_eye.gif" alt="*">.
Click on the iterator below which the offset iterator is to be
inserted (the 'chop' iterator in the image above), then click on
the iterator menu on the left-hand panel of the OT window and
select the offset iterator.  Be sure to "drag" the photom/sample
eye-con to the right, so that it is indented with respect to the
offset iterator (see figure above).<p>

The offset is specified in arcseconds in the 'p' and 'q' boxes.
Note the orientation of these axes to the left of the 'Title' box.
In an unrotated frame, 'p' is in the positive r.a. direction
(i.e. east) while 'q' is in the declination direction (i.e. north).
If a rotated frame is required, enter the position angle (measured
east of north) in the 'PA' box.  If you then click on the 'Display
Derotated Offsets' button, the specified offsets in the unrotated
frame will be briefly displayed in the table above.<p>

To add more offsets, click the 'New' button, and enter the offset
in the 'p' and 'q' boxes as above.  Repeat for as many positions as
required.<p>

A regular grid can also be specified using the 'Grid Pattern'
section of the window.  See the section on <a
href="#het_grid_folder">Grid Maps</a> for a description.  Note that
all offsets at the JCMT are defined in the Gnomonic (TAN)
projection.

<h2><a name="het_sample">The photom/sample eye</a></h2>

 The science observation itself is represented within the MSB by the
 photom/sample eye. Click on it to display the details of the
 observation. The pull down menu near the top of the right hand frame
 allows the user to choose from beam switching or position switching.

 In this example we are beam-switching, and the chop throw was set
 with the <a href="#het_tci">chop iterator</a>.  In the "Secs per
 offset sample" box, enter the <b>total on-source integration time</b>
 per sample position in seconds. (Note this is different from how it's
 been done in the past when we specified the on+off time.) The
 estimated RMS noise per channel is shown in the "Noise" box.  Typical
 recommended on-source integration times per sample are 5 to 10
 minutes. We advise to use no observing times >15 minutes, at the risk
 of loosing observations when something goes wrong.

 <p>
 The Continuum Mode box can be checked if you need an accurate
 measurement of the continuum level. Typically this only makes sense
 when doing a BMSW observation, because the switching time for PSSW
 observations are too long for a reliable determination of the
 continuum. For BMSW observations, the effect of checking 'Continuum
 mode' is to run the chopper much faster. This will result in higher
 overheads which can significantly increase the time it takes for the
 observation to complete. Hence, this mode should only be used when
 really needed. As a concrete example: the maximum time between chops
 typically allows for the completion of a full 9x9 jiggle with 0.1sec
 step, i.e. 8.1 secs. The chopper will then spend ~3 secs in the
 off-position, resulting in an 11-sec cycle plus some overhead. In
 continuum mode the chopper will move to the reference every 0.1secs
 and spend equal times in the 'on' and 'ref' position. A 9x9 jiggle will
 thus take 16.2 secs plus significantly more overheads due to transit
 times of the chopper. Limited testing so far suggests that the typical
 penalty for using continuum mode is an increase of the observing time
 by a factor of 1.7.
<p>

    <h2><a name="het_time">The repeat iterator and integration time in 
general</a></h2>

    Back to your Science Program window now. Click on the Repeat
    iterator. It's only property is a repeat counter:<p>

      <img src="het_images/het_repeat.gif" alt="The Repeat Iterator" ><p>

      The repeat iterator acts on things that are
      <strong>inside</strong> the repeat iterator (i.e. indented under
      it) in turn. So if you set it to 2, your science observation
      consist of two spectral line samples; i.e you will end up with
      precisely two spectral line observations. If you require a long 
      integration of a
      source, it makes sense to break the observation down into
      shorter integrations of around ten minutes or so, so that data
      quality can be assessed as the observation progresses. In
      practice, you set up the integration time required per spectral line
      observation
      using the photom/sample eye and then use the repeat iterator to
      define a sufficient number of repeats to give the total required
      integration time.<p>

      Now you can see how your time usage builds up. Working our way
      inside out (and bottom to top): <p>

<ul>
      <li><img src="images/icon_eye.gif" alt="*"> The photom/sample
      eye is set to an on-source integration time (and shows you the
      estimated RMS noise) which will end up in a single file.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_iterator.gif" alt="*">The Repeat
      iterator multiplies the number of times the sample is carried
      out. If you increase it from the default of 1, don't forget to
      take that into account when calculating how deep you will go.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_component.gif" alt="*">The observation
      component shows you the estimated time of the sequence it
      contains.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_msb.gif" alt="*">The MSB component
      will give you the estimated time of the observations inside
      it. For the heterodyne OT, you only need to define MSBs for
      your science observations. Obviously, before the observation,
      the TSS will tune the receiver (when necessary), focus the telescope, 
      and do a pointing observation. Specific calibration
      instructions, for example, the observation of a spectral line
      standard and/or a planet should be described in the note attached
      to the MSB. Be sure to remember to click the show-to-observer
      tick box for the note. In conclusion, the estimated time for an MSB 
only includes
      observations of the science target - one should remember there
      will be instrument set up and calibration overheads on top of
      this when planning your observing program.<p>

      <li><img src="images/sci_prog.gif" alt="*">The Science Program will 
give you the estimated time of all
      MSBs inside it including the number of repeats. So if you have a
      1hr MSB (as in this example) and you set the MSB counter to 2,
      your MSB estimated time will be 1hr and your Science Program
      time will show 2hrs.
      Remember that different MSBs may be observed on different nights, 
      whereas observations within a single MSB will be observed within a
      aingle night. 
</ul>

<h2> <a name="het_note">Adding information in "Note" elements 
</a></h2>


 By default, the heterodyne library MSBs contain one note element at
 the beginning of the MSB. This consists of a text window where you
 can include textual information, with the option of showing the note
 to the observer and TSS at the time the observation is made. If you
 click on the note icon, the right hand panel allows you to enter the
 name of the note and the main text body of the note. The
 "Show to observer" check-box should be checked if you want the
 note to be visible for the observer/TSS at the time of
 observation. It is <em>strongly</em> recommended that each of your MSBs
 contains at least one "Show to observer" note. All of the information
 about the observation not covered by other elements of the MSB should
 be included in "show to observer" notes. This would be much of the
 material which would have previously gone into the "Overall Strategy"
 and "Observing Cookbook" sections of heterodyne observing
 templates. It is important to note that calibration details are
 not yet explicitly included in heterodyne MSBs, so the observer should spell 
 out the required calibration observations in a "show to observer" note.<p>
 
 <img src="het_images/het_note.gif" alt="A note example" ><p>


Setting the "Show to observer" tick box brings up a "Completion
Parameter" and "binning" field. These should contain information which
help the observer and TSS to decide when to consider your observation
to be complete. By default, your program will be executed with exactly
the number of integration and number of repeats as specified. However,
where possible, an attempt will be made to optimize the process using
the specified Completion Parameters. The detailed logistics of the
scheduling may prevent this, but when possible this may save time for your
project or guarantee the results. For instance you may want to
allow for more time than the MSBs nominally take to allow for the
addition of extra repeats in order to ensure the requested
rms. Setting a S/N target may save unnecassary repeats, etc.
The "Completion Parameter" should include a value for the total
expired time, and/or a required signals-to-noise, and/or RMS noise
value. Best is to provide all three and whichever one is reached first
determines the completion. The assumed bin size, either in km/s or
MHz, should be entered in the "Binning" field. The above screenshot
shows an example of a possible "Show to observer" for an extragalactic
spectral line observation.  Be aware, however, that ultimately it is up to
	  <b>YOU</b>, the PI, to determine when the data have
	  sufficient S/N, by downloading and analyzing 
	  your data soon after they are
	  acquired and updating your MSBs as required.
<p>

 Additional notes can be inserted at any point in the MSB from the
 icon menu and you may have more than one "show to observer" notes in
 an MSB. For example, you could choose to insert a "show to observer"
 note above the "chop" element to clarify the use of an unusual
 chopping scheme.<p>

 Finally, there is no need to repeat information in notes that is
 already included in other components of the MSB. This might include
 receiver tunings, chop throws, offset positions and science
 targets. All of these should be set up in the appropriate MSB
 components. If they are reproduced in notes, there is a risk that
 changes made to main body of the MSB will not be reflected in the
 notes, leading to conflicts between the notes and the MSB components
 resulting in confusion at the telescope.<p>
 
<!-- 
############################################################################ 
--> <h2><a name="het_summary">Summary: Making your heterodyne MSB</a></h2>

 So far, the various elements of the MSB have been described. 
 We now summarise the general procedure for making your own.<p>

<ul>

<li> Choose the corresponding MSB template from the heterodyne library and 
     copy/paste it to your science program.  Each of these is described
		briefly <a href="#het_supported">below</a>.

<li> Fill out the het setup component with the frontend/backend details 
     for your observation.

<li> Set up the site quality component, normally this means simply leaving 
     the "allocated" button checked.

<li> Enter the target information for your target. This step can be as 
     simple as entering the RA/DEC and epoch. Don't forget there are
     the useful tools of the Name resolver and the position editor to
     help you out here.

<li> Set up the chop iterator. Again this can simply mean entering the
     chop throw angle and reference frame, or this iterator can be set up
     via the position editor.

<li> Set up the photom/sample eye. Remember to enter the total
     on-source integration time per sample.

<li> Set up the repeat counter to give the number of repeats of the
     time set up in the photom/sample eye to get your total required
     integration time. If you want a total integration of 30 minutes
     on-source, you should set up an integration time of 5 minutes in
     the photom/sample eye and set the repeat counter to 6. When
     observing, you can then monitor the observation by inspecting the
     data file produced every ~13 minutes, and co-add the spectra as
     you go along. In general, if you want to build up long
     integrations, you will want the duration of the basic observation
     to be of the order 10-15 minutes <em>("on+off+overheads")</em>.

<li> Add at least one "show to observer" note. This should contain 
     additional information on the overall aims of your science
     program, details of required calibrations and any other special
     notices you want the observer and TSS to act upon when the
     observation is made.

<li> Click on the outermost level of the MSB. In the right hand panel you 
     should give the MSB a meaningful name. Be aware that observers and operator 
     typically will see only the start of that line in the browsing tool, hence
     put the most significant information at the start. E.g.<br>
       'IRC+10216 spectral line survey, CO molecule, transition 230.538'<br>
       'IRC+10216 spectral line survey, CO molecule, transition 220.399'<br>
     will look similar without expanding the name field in the browser. Instead<br>
       'IRC+10216 230.538, spectral line survey, CO molecule'<br>
       'IRC+10216 220.399, spectral line survey, CO molecule'<br>
     would be a better compromise.

     Below the name field, there is pull down menu labeled
     "Observe". This counter allows you to control how many times you
     want the whole MSB observed. If you want it done just once, leave
     this as (1x). You can set the relative priority of the MSB within
     your science program using the "Priority" pull down menu. Set
     this between 1 and 99, with 1 signifying the highest
     priority. </ul>

 That's pretty much all you need to know to start preparing your
 MSB. The remainder of this primer covers the Heterodyne
 MSB library. <!-- 
############################################################################

<h2><a name="het_msblib">The Heterodyne MSB library</a></h2>

The heterodyne library groups the MSB templates according to
whether the observation is to be a Sample, a Grid-Pssw, a Raster-Pssw,
or a Jiggle-Chop:<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#het_sam_folder">Single-spectrum samples:</a>
this is the most fundamental mode, in being a single spectrum observed
toward at a single position. The sample can either use a position
switch (<em>Sample-PSSW</em>) or a beam switch (<em>Sample-BMSW</em>).
PSSW observations typically spend of order 30 secs on the source
before going to the reference position for 30 secs, but they can
accommodate large switches exceeding several degrees.  BMSW
observations by contrast offer a better sky cancellation by switching
much faster between the source and reference (up to several Hertz in
'continuum mode'), but are restricted to a switch of maximally
180". Also, the telescope will <em>nod</em>: half the time will be
spend chopping to one side of the source, half to the other side,
requiring both sky positions to be free of emission.<p>

The offset iterator can be used to observe at a position offset from
the one specified in the <a href="#het_tcc">Target Component</a>.
If you specify multiple targets these modes will be equivalent to a
Grid-PSSW or a Jiggle-Chop, although the detailed execution will be
different in case of the latter (see below).</li><p>

<li><a href="#het_grid_folder">Grid-PSSW:</a> this mode actually is
the same as a Sample-PSSW switch carried out at multiple offsets,
either in a regular grid or as a series of explicit offsets. (Better
said: a Sample-PSSW formally is a Grid-PSSW with only a single
offset). Grid-PSSW maps are used where relatively small maps are
required with longish integration times per point.</li><p>

<li><a href="#het_jig_folder">Jiggle-Chop:</a> this mode makes a small
map by "jiggling" the secondary mirror rapidly over all the points in
the map and is similar to Sample-BMSW observations on a regular,
pre-defined grid, such as a 5x5 pattern.  There is an important
distinction: rather than fully completing each position before going
to the next, as would happen with an Sample-BMSW inside an Offset
Iterator, Jiggle-Chop will combine sequences of short integrations at
each position covering the whole jiggle pattern many times. As in
Raster-PSSW it will typically observe multiple source positions before
going to the reference position for a relatively longer time.<p>

Jiggle-Chop is new to heterodyne observing at the JCMT, and
specifically designed for HARP although useful for single "pixel"
receivers as well.</li><p>

<li><a href="#het_rast_folder">Raster-PSSW:</a> This mode is useful
for making large maps rapidly. The telescope continuously takes data
while scanning across the source in e.g. a back-and-forth pattern. It
will typically go to the reference between rows and an interpolation
of the references on either side of the row will be used for each of
the samples in the row. This mode is much more efficient to map large
regions than Grid-Pssw.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="het_sam_folder">Samples</a> </h3>

A sample denotes an observation consisting of one pointing per science
target. It can be beam switched (BMSW) or position switched (PSSW).  
<!-- fast frequency switched or slow frequency switched.--> 

If you open up the PSSW sample MSB in the heterodyne library, you will
see that it contains the same elements as the BMSW MSB, with the
exception of the "chop" component. Opening the "Target Component"
component, however, reveals two rows in the bottom right hand window,
a SCIENCE and a REFERENCE row. Clicking on one of them allows the user
to specify the co-ordinates of either the SCIENCE, or "on" position,
or the REFERENCE or "off" position. The REFERENCE position can either
be specified as a co-ordinate offset from the SCIENCE position, by
checking the "offset" tick-box, or as an absolute co-ordinate, by
leaving the "offset" tick-box unchecked.<p>

<em>Important</em>: If you put or leave a REFERENCE position in the
Target Component of a chopped observation (Sample-BMSW, Jiggle-Chop)
that position will be used when doing a three-load calibration
(hot-cold-sky).

<!--
For the Fast and slow frequency switching MSBs, one does not specify a
chop or offset position, rather one specifies a frequency throw within
the modified "Photom/Sample" eye.  <p>
-->

For all sample modes, the <i>total</i> "on" integration time per
sample is indicated in the "Photom/Sample" eye. <blink>Note</blink>
that integration time no longer is the "on+off" time, only the "on"
time.

<h3> <a name="het_grid_folder">Grid-PSSW Maps</a> </h3>

Observations of a single science target at multiple positions are
generically referred to as Grid observations. Note that the user can
define exactly the position offsets required from the map centre, and
there is no requirement that the pointings form a regularly shaped
grid. Opening the various grid MSBs in the heterodyne library shows
they are similar to the Sample-PSSW MSBs except for the addition of an
<a href="#het_offset">Offset Iterator</a>. This iterator enables
the user to specify the required pointings for the observation.<p>

Suppose the user requires three pointings along the long axis of a
galaxy, at a half beam width spacing of 10 arcseconds. Let us assume
the long axis of the galaxy has a position angle of 30 degrees on the
sky. First enter the position angle in the "P.A." field. The rotated
frame has axes labeled p and q, so in order to obtain the required
pointings along our galaxy we require (p,q) offsets of (0,-10), (0,0)
and (0,10). One adds a new pointing by clicking on the "New"
button. One then modifies the offsets via the p and q boxes directly
above the "New" button. The highlighted pointing can be removed using
the "Remove" button. The "Rm. all" button removes all of the
user-added pointings. The arrow buttons to the right of the box
displaying the pointings allow the pointings to be re-ordered. The
highlight pointing can be advanced one position up or down the
pointing list, or to the top or bottom of the list by clicking on
these arrow buttons. For our example, the completed Offset Iterator
will appear as shown below. <p>

<img src="het_images/het_offset2.gif" alt="The Offset Iterator (2)" ><p>

If you want to see what the offsets are in the sky frame (which will
be the co-ordinate frame specified in the "target information"
element), click and hold the "Display Derotated Offsets" button.<p>

The Offset Iterator has the ability to automatically generate
regularly spaced grids without the need to enter each pointing
individually. The "Grid Pattern" section of the "Offset iterator"
allows the user to specify the offset of the top-left corner of the
	  grid (i.e. most positive 'p' and 'q'), the grid point spacing,
and the dimensions of the grid, in grid points. To create a 3x3 grid,
with a ten arcsecond spacing, one would fill in the fields of the grid
pattern section as illustrated below, and then click on either
"Create/Centre on Base" button, or the "Create" i.e. on corner
button. The pointings generated then appear in the pointing list box
above. 

<p>Notice that "Create/Centre on Base" chooses the the geometrical
centre of the grid for the (0,0) position, and ignores the contents of
	  the "initial offset" fields. The "Create" (on corner) button, on the
	  other hand, will place the top left pixel at the offset
	  specified in the "initial offset" fields.  For example, if
	  you want a 2x2 grid with 10 arcsecond spacing at offsets
	  (0,0),(-10",0),(-10",-10"),(0,-10"), then set the initial
	  offsets to p=0,q=0, spacing p=10",q=10", and dimensions 2x2,
	  and click the "Create" button. <p>

<img src="het_images/het_offset3.gif" alt="The Offset Iterator (3)"><p>

<h3> <a name="het_jig_folder">Jiggle Mapping</a> </h3>

<p>Jiggle-Chop observations, like Grid-PSSW, map a region around a
	  source. This mode is primarily intended for array
	  instruments with widely spaced receptors for which
	  'jiggling' is needed in order to achieve a Nyquist
	  sampling. Nevertheless it is available for single-pixels
	  receivers as well. 

<p>As opposed to Grid-PSSW, the chopping secondary is used to move
	  over the chosen jiggle pattern. This allows for a fast
	  switching of the position and makes it possible to observe
	  e.g. the whole jiggle pattern before going to the reference
	  position.  (In "continuum mode", however, where the chop
	  frequency is much higher, half the time is spent at the
	  reference position.) Jiggle-chops are <b>beam-switched
	    observations</b>, and hence the distance to the reference
	  can be no more than 180".  Note also that Jiggle-chops are
	  <em>array centered</em>, i.e. the center of the jiggle
	  pattern is the center of the array. 

<p>Opening the various chop MSBs in the heterodyne library shows they
	  are similar to the Sample-BMSW example above except that
	  there is a "jiggle eye" instead of the "photom/sample
	  eye". It offers various jiggle patterns: 3x3 through 11x11
	  plus HARP specific jiggles (HARP4 and HARP5). HARP4 is a 4x4
	  pattern with 7.5" pixels designed to fill in the footprint,
	  but slightly under Nyquist sampled, and HARP5 is a 5x5
	  pattern with 6" pixels, i.e. slightly better than Nyquist
	  sampled.  For the others, the "Jiggle Spacing" needs to be
	  defined by the user: typically 0.5 or 1 beam-spacing in
	  arcsecs. The PA and System should be left at "0.0" and
	  "Tracking" for the typical user. Finally, the integration
	  time for each jiggle position can be specified as "secs/jig
	  posn". (Note that this is the total "on-source" time per
	  position.) As for the "photom/sample" eye, the estimated RMS
	  noise per channel is shown in the "Noise" box. 

<p>Note that currently (February 2007) there are 3 dead receptors in
	  the bottom row of the HARP array. The orientation of the
	  array can not be pre-determined due to a 90-degree
	  uncertainty caused by the K-mirror rotation.  Thus the
	  effective area that could be fully sampled is 1.5x1.5
	  arcmins in one foot print. It is expected that two receptors
	  will be fixed by the end of March 2007. Before then special
	  techniques are required to make mosaic jiggle maps.  Please
	  contact your <a
	    href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JCMT/allocations/">Friend
	    of the Project</a> for details about this.

"Continuum mode" can be selected as is explained for the <a
href="#het_sample">"photom/sample eye"</a>. Due to the resulting
increase of the time needed to complete the observation, by a factor
of approximately 1.7, only check this if you really need the
measurement of the continuum level.<p>

<em>Important</em>: If you put or leave a REFERENCE position in the
Target Component of a chopped observation (Sample-BMSW, Jiggle-Chop)
that position will be used when doing a three-load calibration
(hot-cold-sky).<p>


<h3> <a name="het_rast_folder">Rasters</a> </h3>

The format of the position switched raster MSB is similar to the
sample MSB, except that the "photom/sample" eye is replaced by the
"scan/raster" eye. The fields in the "Area" panel allow you control
the size and sampling of the raster map. The resulting Nr. of
samples/pixels and Nr. of scans/pixels in each dimension is shown. The
total required on-source integration time per sample point can be specified in
the "Sample time" box.  The system will automatically break up the
observations into multiple passes over the map.

<p>Setting up raster maps is significantly different when using a <a
	    href="#rxa_rast_example">non-array receiver</a> (i.e. RxA
	  or RxW), or an <a href="#harp_rast_example">array
	    receiver</a> (i.e. HARP).  Read the example below for
	  setting up MSBs for an <a href="#rxa_rast_example">RxA/RxW
	    Raster Map</a>, and for a <a
	    href="#harp_rast_example">HARP Raster Map</a>.

<a name="rxa_rast_example"></a><h4>Making a Raster Map With a
	  Non-Array Receiver (RxA/RxW)</h4>

<p>When using a single-pixel receiver such as RxA or RxW, the "sample
	  spacing" will be the 
pixel-size along scan direction of the telescope. The "scan spacing"
will be the pixel-size in the cross-scan direction i.e. between the
scanned rows. Be aware that there will be a pixel centered on the
base position only if the number of pixels in each direction is odd. The
size of the map <em>must</em> be a multiple of the pixel-size in each
direction, and is  defined as the distance between the
<em>centers</em> of the outmost pixels!

<p>Suppose, for example, that you want to use RxA to make a 238"x28"
map. A sample spacing of 7" and scan spacing of 7" will result in a 
pixel map of 35x5. Note that it is customary to oversample the 
scan-direction to counter-act smearing, although this often requires a
regridding of the final map to recover the intended rms/pixel.<p>

<img src="het_images/het_raster.gif" alt="Rasters" ><p>

The sample time box allows the user to set the amount of time data
is taken for for each map "point" as the receiver is scanned across
the sky.  The RMS noise per channel of the final co-added map is
also indicated, as is the estimated time to complete each row and
the complete map.<p>

It is possible to set the scanning direction, but for most purposes
this should be left to the default values.

<p><a name="harp_rast_example"></a><h4>Making a Raster Map With an
	  Array Receiver (i.e. HARP).</h4>

<p>HARP is a 4x4 square array of receptors, which are separated by
	  30".  To make a raster map, the 
	  telescope scans continuously along (by default) the longest
	  axis of the 
	  map (defined by the <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> of
	  the map).  The  
	  array is rotated by 14.04&ordm; to the direction of the
	  scan.  This results in a fully sampled map, with 7.5"
	  pixels.  Thus the <b>sample spacing</b> must be set to
	  7.5".  At the end of a scan, the array is shifted up by the
	  <em>scan spacing</em> and the telescope makes another scan
	  across the area to be mapped.  Normally the <em>scan
	    spacing</em> should be set to 1/2 the array size (58"
	  (i.e. 60"*cos(14&ordm;))) so that each pixel is covered
	  twice by the array, or set the <em>scan spacing</em> to the
	  full array size (87" (i.e. 90"*cos(14&ordm;))) so that
	  there's no overlap.  

<p>(CAVEAT:  Currently (Feb 2007) three of the receptors are not
	  working, effectively making a 3x4 array.  Two of the
	  non-functioning pixels are expected to be repaired in March
	  2007.  Until they are repaired, it is recommended that you
	  use a <em>scan spacing</em> of 44" to assure complete
	  coverage of your map.)

<img src="het_images/harp_raster.gif" alt="HARP Raster" ><p>

<p>Effectively the largest single map one can make is one square
	  degree.  Of course for larger maps the integration time per
	  pixel (<em>sample time</em>) should be set to the minimum
	  value, 0.1 seconds per pixel.  Larger maps can be made, but
	  they should be broken up into smaller pieces, one piece per
	  MSB, with an offset iterator for each piece.  Note that
	  mosaicing such large maps will likely tax most computing
	  systems beyond their capacities.

<p>If the raster map is to be repeated, a useful technique is to
	  "basket weave" the rasters, i.e. make a raster by scanning
	  along one axis of the map, and then repeat by scanning along
	  the other axis.  This minimizes striping in the resultant
	  map. One way to do this is to edit a science observation for a
	  raster map, set the parameters as required, then copy
	  the entire science observation and paste the copy below
	  the original.  In the original raster "eye"-con, set the
	  <em>SCAN PA</em> (lower left panel) to <em>user def</em>,
	  and type in '0'.  Do the same in the copy raster "eye"-con,
	  but set the <em>SCAN PA</em> to '90'.

<p><em>Sample Time</em>:  The <em>sample time</em> is the total
	  integration time <i>per pixel</i> in the completed map.  The
	  minimum time is 0.1 seconds.  There is no maximum time,
	  except that you should make sure the MSB takes no more than
	  1.5 to 2 hours at most.
