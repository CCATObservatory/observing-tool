<h1>Preparing Heterodyne observations </h1>
<!-- ############################################################################ --> 

<h2><a name="het_anat"> Anatomy of a beam-switched MSB </a> </h2>

    Go to the JCMT root window, and open the Heterodyne library:<p>

   <img src="het_images/het_library.gif" alt="Contents of the heterodyne library"><p>

    A window will pop up containing a list of folders. The
    little switch on the left of the folder icons is an open/close
    toggle switch. Push open the folder titled "Samples" and then
    select the MSB labeled "Beam-switch sample(1X) " and click "Copy" on the toolbar.<p>

    <img src="het_images/het_copy.gif" alt="Copying an MSB"><p>

      Now go back to your Science Program window, and click on
      "Paste". The MSB will be dropped into your science
      program. Congratulations! You're now well underway. Now is a
      good time to save your progress, so use the File->Save option in
      your Science Program window and carry on.
<!-- ############################################################################ -->

    <h2><a name="ria">Really Important Aside - or is it Inside? </a></h2>

Do you see how the icon for the MSB is not directly below the icon for
the Science Program but indented to the right? That's because the MSB
is <em>inside</em> the Science Program. This is a classic way of
representing a hierarchical structure, and many of you will be
familiar with it from other applications, such as the "Manage
Bookmarks" screen in the Netscape and Mozilla browsers.


    <h2><a name="het_etmc">Editing the MSB  component</a></h2>

    <p> Click on the title of the MSB. This will activate the MSB
    editor panel on the right section of your window.<p>


      The properties of an MSB are very simple. 

      <ul>

      <li>It has a title, at the moment "Beam-switch sample".  When
 preparing your own MSB, this title should be changed to something
 meaningful describing the observation, usually with target
 name. Examples might be "B/SW observation of OMC1" or "3 point grid
 of M83". <strong>Please</strong> take the time to do this - it
      really helps the person doing the observing.

      <li>A pull down menu with a repeat counter. Leave that to 1 for
      the time being.

      <li>The priority of the MSB. Note that this only affects the
      internal priority of your MSBs - not the priority allocated to
      your entire project by your TAG. So if you had two different
      MSBs that rose to the top of the scheduling queue and one had
      priority "1" and the other "99", the one marked "High" will
      normally get done first. If all your MSBs are of equal interest
      to you, just don't bother changing the default.

	<small>Small print: Bear in mind though that MSB selection is
	an operational decision - marking your MSBs with priorities 1,
	2, 3 etc is no guarantee that they will be done in precisely
	that particular order. For example, your lower-priority MSBs
	could be done because they are observable at a time of day
	where there is not much else in the queue, whereas your
	high-priority MSBs could be competing against the top-ranked
	project. Also, the observer/TSS may sometimes select a lower
	priority MSB because it is the most efficient choice at the
	time, because of its duration or azimuth.</small>

    </ul>

There is also a display of the OT's estimate of how long the MSB
will take. 

<!-- ############################################################################ -->
<h2><a name="het_eoam">Elements of an MSB</a></h2>

    Click on the push lever to open up your MSB. Inside you will find
    a Het Setup component, a Site Quality component and an observation
    component which is labelled "Science Target" at the moment:<p>

<img src="het_images/het_elements.gif" alt="Inside an MSB"><p>

     We'll now go through these individually.
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_thsc">The Het Setup component</a></h2>

<p> If you click on the "Het Setup" component, the properties of that
 component are shown in the right hand side of the science program
 window, as shown below. The purpose of this component is to enable
 the set up of the required heterodyne instrument and the DAS prior to an
 observation. </p>
 

<img src="het_images/het_het_setup.gif" alt="Het Setup component"><p>
<p> The first row of pull down menu's enables the user to setup the
front end using a series of pull down menus.

<ul>
<li> The first menu enables the user to choose the required
receiver. Choose from A3, B3, W(C) or W(D) for receivers A, B, W
(C-band) and W(D-band) respectively.

<li> The next menu allows the user to choose between double sideband
(dsb) and single sideband (ssb) operation. Note receiver A has no
single sideband capabilities, so "dsb" is the only allowed option.
 
<li> The next menu along allows the user to configure the sub-band set
up for ACSIS, when ACSIS is available at the telescope. The DAS does
not allow such configuration, so leave the menu set to "1-system".

<li> The next menu allows the user to choose between a single or a
dual mixer observation. For receiver A, there is only one mixer, so
only "single mixer" will be allowed. Receivers B3 and W have two
mixers, sensitive to orthogonal polarisations of the incoming
radiation. Typically, observations use both mixers simultaneously, and the outputs
from each mixer are averaged together to increase the signal-to-noise
for a given integration time.

<li> The next menu allows the user to request which sideband is used
to observe with. Sideband suppression is not absolute in the SSB
receivers, so the user should avoid, if possible, the situation where the unwanted
sideband corresponds to a frequency where the zenith opacity or
receiver noise is high. If either sideband is okay, choose "best" and
the TSS will use his discretion when making the observation.

</ul>

 The Bandwidth menu allows the user to select the required DAS
    bandwidth (in GHz). The resulting spectral resolution is shown
    automatically updated in the "Resolution" frame. Notice that there
    is also a menu to allow the user to choose so called
    "non-standard" DAS modes. These non-standard modes allow the
    independent configuration of das-subbands to allow for
    simultaneous observations with different subbands set to different
    resolutions and bandwidths, for example. General details of the
    capabilities of the DAS, including non-standard modes, can be found in the 

<a href
="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/JCMT/Heterodyne_observing/Backends/DAS/DAS_guide/das-guide.html">
DAS guide </a>. The list of non-standard modes themselves are briefly
described  <a
    href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACpublic/JCMT/Heterodyne_observing/Backends/DAS/das_nonstandard.txt">
    here </a> <p>



 In order to indicate receiver tuning, the user needs to indicate the
 rest frequency of the spectral line observation, the velocity of the
 object, the velocity definition (radio, optical or redshift), and the
 rest frame (LSR, Geocentric or Heliocentric). The rest frequency of
 the line can be set by choosing the required molecule and transition from the
 pull-down menus, or by entering the frequency manually, in MHz, in the
 frequency field. Note that if you enter a redshift, you are expected
 to enter the dimensionless redshift rather than <em>cz</em>.

 <p>Having entered the required line transition, velocity, velocity
 definition and frame, click the "Accept Values" button to finalise
 them. Note that manually entering frequency values in the rest frequency field
 causes the molecule and transition menus take on values of "No
 Line", even if the frequency does in fact correspond to a known
 transition. Lookup occurs from molecule/transition to frequency only -
 no lookup is done in the opposite direction.

 <p>For example, suppose we would like to look for a broad CO(3-2)
 extragalactic line using Rx B3 in an object with cz=12,000 km/s. We
 would choose Rx B3, ssb, dual mixer observing and a DAS backend of
 0.92 GHz using the pull down menus. The line and transition would be
 selected by choosing "CO" and "3-2" from the pull down menu's and the
 velocity entered (12,000 km/s) in the velocity field (after setting
 up the appropriate velocity definition). The IF frequency for Rx B3
 is 4 GHz, so the image sideband will be 8 GHz above or below the
 required observing frequency (332 GHz), depending on whether we
 choose to observe using the lower or upper sideband. There is an
 atmospheric water absorption feature at 325 GHz, so it makes sense to
 observe using the lower sideband by choosing "lsb" from the pull-down
 menu, so that the image sideband does not contribute unwanted noise
 by being near the 325 GHz absorption feature. The appearance of the
 completed het setup component is shown below. MAKE SURE you click the "Accept
 values" button when you are finished editing - it will grey itself out,
 indicating your values have been properly internalised.
</p>

 
<img src="het_images/het_filled_het_setup.gif" alt="Completed het setup
window"><p>

  The het-setup component also includes a "Frequency Editor" tool. This
 can be useful in setting choosing your observing frequencies and
 bandwidths, particularly where you might want to observe several
 lines at once with DSB receivers, or use non-standard DAS
 settings. We'll postpone looking at this for now.<p>

<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_tsc">The Site Quality component</a></h2>
 
    The Site Quality component specifies any weather-related
    scheduling requirements for an MSB. Click on the Site Quality
    component to get the Site Quality panel:<p>

    <img src="het_images/het_site_quality.gif" alt="Site Quality Component"><p>

     You probably don't need to change anything here, except if your
program is using different receivers (where you don't want an RxW
project done in grade 5 weather or an RxA project in grade 2
weather). The default value of tau of "Allocated" means that your MSB
can be scheduled when the tau is in the range that was specified by
your TAG for your project. The default value of the sub-millimetre
seeing is "Don't Care".

<!-- If you think you need to change these values, click
     on the note entitled "Note: Site Quality" which contains a
     lengthy explanation, but don't get bogged down in this for
     now. -->
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_tfoc">The observation: Science Target</a></h2>

    Now click on the science target to bring up its panel. If you recursively open all of the toggle switches, the individual components of the science target will be displayed as a hierarchy, as shown below.<p>
 
    <img src="het_images/sci_tar.gif" alt="Science target"><p>

 The first element inside the Science target is the "Target
      information" component. We will discuss this shortly. Next there
      is a sequence iterator which contains a repeat iterator, a chop
      iterator and a single "eye". The sequence iterator doesn't do
      anything per se, so you can ignore it for the moment, but it is
      important to note that it represents the sequence of events at
      the telescope. The repeat iterator allows the user to control
      the number of repeats carried out for a certain observation. The
      "eye" icon represents the observation itself. Before explaining
      the function of each of these elements, the nomenclature of the
      elements of a general MSB will be reviewed. <p>

<h2><a name="thingies">Components, Iterators And All That</a></h2>

We've talked about several things so far, so it's time to have a quick
run down. <p>

<ul>

      <li> <img src="images/icon_msb.gif" alt="*">MSBs
      <strong>are</strong> individually schedulable blocks and
      <strong>contain</strong> one or more fully specified science
      observation and any calibrations. For heterodyne observations,
      calibrations will be described in a show-to-observer note,
      whereas SCUBA MSBs have a dedicated calibration component.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_observation.gif" alt="*">Observations
      <strong>are</strong> observations of a single astronomical
	target and <strong>contain</strong> components and a sequence.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_component.gif" alt="*">Components
      <strong>are</strong> configurators for the JCMT systems such as
      the instrument (het setup component), the telescope (Target
      component) and the scheduler (Site Quality component). <p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_iterator.gif" alt="*">Iterators
      <strong>are</strong> potentially multiple actions and
      <strong>contain</strong> other iterators and one or more
      eyes.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_eye.gif" alt="*">Eyes
      <strong>are</strong> actions that results in the actual taking
      of data - a single data file per eye to be precise.<p>


      <li><img src="images/icon_note.gif" alt="*">Notes
      <strong>are</strong> a repository of useful information and can
      go anywhere.<p>

</ul>
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_tcc">The target component</a></h2>

    Click on the target component to bring up its panel:<p>
    
   <img src="het_images/het_target.gif" alt="The Target component"><p>

      At first glance you might think that what you have to do here is
      enter your target name and position and you can certainly do
      that. However you can do even less than that - if you are using
      a machine with an Internet connection try just entering the name
      of your target (in our example the IRAS source 18592+0108) and
      hit "Resolve Name".<p>

      After a brief pause the RA and DEC co-ordinate fields are
      populated with the SIMBAD co-ordinates for the source. The
      SIMBAD name for the source will also be indicated next to the
      "Resolve Name" button.  And of course, double check that the
      co-ordinates are those you intend to observe.<p>

      But wait - that's not all.<p>
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_tpe">The position editor</a></h2>

    You can skip this section if you want because you don't have to do
    anything, but it's kind of cool and can be very useful in picking
    a good chop position. Click on the plot button at the bottom left
    of the target panel:<p>

   <img src="images/plot.gif" alt="Plotting a position"><p>

      A whole new window will pop up - this is the position
      editor. Looks a bit boring at the moment though, with just a
      small green crosshair in the middle. Let's make it a bit more
      interesting - go to Catalog menu and into the Image Servers item
      and chose a Digital Sky Survey near near you:<p>

   <img src="het_images/het_tpe.gif" alt="The Position editor"><p>

      It's now full of stars. The display application, by the way, is
      is based on JSky, for those familiar with it. <p>

      The DSS may not be the most useful survey for planning
      sub-millimetre observations, but you can read in any FITS image
      with an appropriate WCS header using Open under the File
      menu. You can also fetch a FITS image over the Web.

      In the screenshot below I have loaded the SCUBA commissioning
      scan map of W48 <em>(image courtesy Tim Jenness)</em>. If you
      have an Internet connection, go to the File menu, select "Open
      URL...:" and type in the following URL: <a
      href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JAC/software/jcmtot/w48.fits">http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JAC/software/jcmtot/w48.fits</a>
      or download the image by clicking on the link and and use
      File-&gt;Open to read it in:<p>

      <img src="het_images/w48.gif" alt="W48"><p>

      You will then see the DSS image replaced with the sub-millimetre
      image.<p>

      <blockquote>
      <small>A short technical note if you are planning on generating your own
      image for import: if you want to import a SCUBA map in NDF format,

      utility with the following arguments:

    If you have difficulty despite doing this, let us know.</small></blockquote>


    <p>As I mentioned before, the green cross-hair is the position of
    your science co-ordinates. Click on the button on the left side of
    the position editor entitled "Sci Area". The circle that is drawn
    is the HPBW of the chosen heterodyne receiver.<p>

    Now for the useful thing I mentioned earlier. While leaving the
    position editor window open, go back to your science program
    window and click on your chop iterator that is inside your science
    observation. Now look at the position editor. The chop beams and
    the area in which they will rotate during integration are
    drawn. Well, that's no good - we're chopping onto bright stuff! 
    <p>

 <img src="het_images/het_bright_chop.gif" alt="bright stuff"><p>

    This is where the position editor comes into its own. We are going
    to use it to specify where exactly we would like to chop. In the
    chop iterator, use the drop down menu to change the chopping
    co-ordinate frame from AZEL to TRACKING (i.e. RA/DEC). You will
    notice that in the position editor the uncertainty circles have
    disappeared, since we will always chop in the same position in the
    sky:<p>

      <img src="het_images/het_tracking_chop.gif" alt="Chop and the Position Editor"><p>
	   
 Now back in the position editor, click on the Drag button on the
 upper left side of the window. The click on the centre of one of the
	   chop beams in the display and drag it away from the emission:<p>

      <img src="het_images/het_tracking_chop2.gif" alt="Dragging the Chop"><p>

      You will note that the values in the chop iterator have
      automatically changed to reflect the new chop throw and angle
      values. Neat, eh? Remember that by default, any calibrations for
      you observations will be preformed with the same chop as the
      science observation. <p>

      You can also click on the target component and use Drag to
      change your science co-ordinates if you wish. 
<!-- ############################################################################ -->

    <h2><a name="het_tci">The chop iterator</a></h2>

    Click on the chop iterator:<p>


    <img src="het_images/het_chop.gif" alt="The Chop Iterator"><p>

      The chop iterator has a list of chop configurations (in this
      example only one 60 arcsecond chop, but their could be more for
      SCUBA observations). Each chop needs to be specified by a throw,
      an angle, and co-ordinate frame of the angle. In this example
      the frame is AZEL (Azimuth Elevation) but other common options
      are TRACKING (RA & Dec) or FPLANE (Focal Plane, i.e. Nasmyth for
      SCUBA). A 60 arcsecond chop with an angle of 90 degrees AZEL
      (i.e. 60 arcsec in the azimuth direction) is typical for
      beamswitched observations of compact sources. If the source is
      extended, one might want to increase the chop throw, or if the
      source was elongated in one direction on the sky, chop relative
      to the RA/DEC frame. <p>

<!-- ############################################################################ -->
 <h2><a name="het_sample">The photom/sample eye</a></h2>

  The science observation itself is represented within the MSB by the
 photom/sample eye. Click on it to display the details of the
 observation. The pull down menu near the top of the right hand frame
 allows the user to choose from beam switching, position switching or
 fast or slow frequency switching. The integration time for the
 observation is set by choosing the number of cycles required from the
 pull down menu. The total number of seconds per cycle is also
 indicated, so one would choose ten integration cycles to get a ten
 minute integration (half on, half off source) if we had 60 seconds
 per cycle. The calculated RMS noise for the photom/sample eye is also
 indicated. This will be RMS noise for the single observation (single
 GSD file). In general, you will use the repeat iterator described
 below to produce a set of GSD files which you can co-add to give
 obtain your requisite RMS noise. <p>

 <img src="het_images/het_eye.gif" alt="The photom/sample eye"><p>

 For most purposes, the "continuous cal" check box should be left
 ticked. Continuous calibration, where hot load/cold load calibrations
 are done continuously as the observation is made, rather than just at the
 beginning and end, are desirable except for Receiver W in medium/bad
 weather conditions or for certain specialised observing modes
 (e.g. chopping onto opposite planetary limbs of rotating planets). In
 general, its best to leave the box checked and rely on the TSS to make
 the correct decision at the time of observation.<p>  
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
    <h2><a name="het_time">The repeat iterator and integration time in general</a></h2>

    Back to your Science Program window now. Click on the Repeat
    iterator. It's only property is a repeat counter:<p>

      <img src="het_images/het_repeat.gif" alt="The Repeat Iterator"><p>

      The repeat iterator acts on things that are
      <strong>inside</strong> the repeat iterator (i.e. indented under
      it) in turn. So if you set it to 2, your science observation
      consist of two spectral line samples i.e you will end up with
      precisely two GSD files. If you require a long integration of a
      source, it makes sense to break the observation down into
      shorter integrations of around ten minutes or so, so that data
      quality can be assessed as the observation progresses. In
      practice, you set up the integration time required per GSD file
      using the photom/sample eye and then use the repeat iterator to
      define a sufficient number of repeats to give the total required
      integration time.<p>

      Now you can see how your time usage builds up. Working our way
      inside out (and bottom to top): <p>

<ul>
      <li><img src="images/icon_eye.gif" alt="*"> The photom/sample
      eye can be set to a number of integrations (and shows you the
      estimated RMS noise) that will result from the number of chop
      cycles which will end up in a single file.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_iterator.gif" alt="*">The Repeat
      iterator multiplies the number of times the sample is carried
      out. If you increase it from the default of 1, don't forget to
      take that into account when calculating how deep you will go.<p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_component.gif" alt="*">The observation
      component shows you the estimated time of the sequence it
      contains. <p>

      <li><img src="images/icon_msb.gif" alt="*">The MSB component
      will give you the estimated time of the observations inside
      it. For the heterodyne OT, you only need to define MSB's for
      your science observations. Obviously, before the observation,
      the TSS will tune the receiver and focus the telescope, and
      perform a spectral line fivepoint. Specific calibration
      instructions, for example, the observation of a spectral line
      standard and/or a planet should be described in the note attached
      to the MSB. Be sure to remember to click the show-to-observer
      tick box for the note. In conclusion, the estimated time for an MSB only includes
      observations of the science target - one should remember there
      will be instrument set up and calibration overheads on top of
      this when planning your observing program. <p>

      <li><img src="images/sci_prog.gif" alt="*">The Science Program will give you the estimated time of all
      MSBs inside it including the number of repeats. So if you have a
      1hr MSB (as in this example) and you set the MSB counter to 2,
      your MSB estimated time will be 1hr and your Science Program
      time will show 2hrs.

</ul>

    I hope that makes sense.
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
<h2> <a name="het_note">Adding  a note</a></h2>

  One potentially important part of a heterodyne MSB is not included
 in the template from the heterodyne library - the "Note"
 element. This consists of a text window where you can include textual
 information, with the option of showing the note to the observer and
 TSS at the time the observation is made. Let's add a note at the
 beginning of our MSB. <p>

 <img src="het_images/note1.gif" alt="adding a note (1)"><p>

If you select the outer MSB icon, and then click on the note icon on
the left hand bar of the window, a note appears in the MSB as shown
above. Ideally we want this note to be the first item in the MSB, so
you move it by dragging it with the mouse and dropping it just below
the outer MSB icon. The repositioned note should now appear as below. <p>

 <img src="het_images/note2.gif" alt="adding a note (2)"><p>

 If you click on the note icon, the right hand panel allows you to
 enter the name of the note and the main text body of the note. There
 is also a "Show to observer" checkbox which should be checked if you
 want the note to be visible for the observer/TSS at the time of
 observation. All of the information about the observation not covered
 by other elements of the MSB should be included in "show to observer"
 notes. This would be much of the material which would have previously gone
 into the "Overall Strategy" and "Observing Cookbook" sections of
 heterodyne observing templates. It is important to note that
 calibration details are explicity included in heterodyne
 MSBs as they are for SCUBA MSBs, so the heterodyne observer should
 spell out the required calibration observations in a "show to observer"
 note.<p>
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
<h2><a name="het_summary">Summary: Making your heterodyne MSB.</a></h2>

 So far, I have described, the various elements of the MSB. I'd like
 to summarise the general procedure for making your own.<p>

<ul>

<li> Choose the corresponding MSB template from the heterodyne library
and copy/paste it to your science program.

<li> Fill out the het setup component with the frontend/backend
details for your observation.

<li> Set up the site quality component, normally this means simply
leaving the "allocated" button checked. 

<li> Enter the target information for your target. This step can be as
simple as entering the RA/DEC and epoch. Don't forget there are the
useful tools of the Name resolver and the position
editor to help you out here.

<li> Set up the chop component. Again this can simply mean entering the
chop throw angle and reference frame, or this component can be set up
via the position editor.

<li> Set up the photom/sample eye. Remember the one-to-one
correspondence between the duration you set up here and the integration
time per GSD file produced.

<li> Set up the repeat counter to give the number of repeats of the
time set up in the photom/sample eye to get your total required
integration time. If you want a total integration of one hour, you should
set up an integration time of 10 minutes in the photom/sample eye and
set the repeat counter to six. When observing, you can then monitor
the observation by inspecting the GSD file produced every ten minutes,
and co-add the spectra as you go along. In general, if you want to
build up long integrations, you will want the basic sample length to
be around 10 minutes for RxW and RxB and around 15-20 minutes for RxA.


<li> Add a "show to observer" note. This should contain additional
information on the overall aims of your science program, details of
required calibrations and any other special notices you want the
observer and TSS to act upon when the observation is made.

<li> Click on the outer most level of the MSB. In the right hand panel
you should give the MSB a meaningful name. Below the name field, there
is pull down menu labeled "Observe". This counter allows you to
control how many times you want the whole MSB observed. If you want it
done just once, leave this as (1x). You can set the relative priority
of the MSB within your science program using the "Priority" pull down
menu. Set this between 1 and 99, with 1 signifying the highest
priority.
</ul>

 That's pretty much all you need to know to start preparing your
 MSB. The remainder of this primer covers the rest of the Heterodyne
 MSB library and the frequency editor tool in the heterodyne setup
 component. 
<!-- ############################################################################ -->
<h2><a name="het_msblib">The Heterodyne MSB library</a></h2>

 The heterodyne library groups the MSB templates according to whether
 the observation is to be a sample, a grid or a raster. For samples
 and grids, the user can choose beam switching, position switching or
 fast or slow frequency switching, whereas raster observations only
 allow position switching. The similarities and differences of the
 heterodyne library MSBs will be discussed below, and the user should
 consult the JCMT User Guide for a more complete description of the
 observing modes themselves.

<h3> Samples </h3>

 A sample denotes an observation consisting of one pointing per science
 target, and can be beam switched, position switched, fast frequency
 switched or slow frequency switched. If you open up the position
 switched sample MSB in the heterodyne library, you will see that it
 contains the same elements as the beam-switched MSB, with the
 exception of the "chop" component. Opening the "Target Information"
 component, however, reveals two rows in the bottom right hand
 window, a SCIENCE and a REFERENCE row. Clicking on one of them allows
 the user to specify the co-ordinates of either the SCIENCE, or "on"
 position, or the REFERENCE or "off" position. The REFERENCE position
 can either be specified as a co-ordinate offset from the SCIENCE
 position, by checking the "offset" tick-box, or as an absolute
 co-ordinate, by leaving the "offset" tick-box unchecked.<p>

 For the Fast and slow frequency switching MSBs, one does not specify
 a chop or offset position, rather one specifies a frequency throw and
 switching rate within the modified "Photom/Sample" eye. Fast
 frequency switching allows the user to specify both frequency throw
 and rate, whereas for slow frequency switching the rate is set to the
 reciprocal of the cycle time. <p>
 
<h3> Grids </h3>

 Observations of a single science target, at multiple positions are
 generically referred to as Grid observations. Note that the user
 can define exactly the position offsets required from the map centre,
 and there is no requirement that the pointings form a regularly
 shaped grid. Opening the various grid MSBs in the heterodyne library
 shows they are similar to the sample MSBs except for the addition of
 an "offset" iterator. This iterator enables the user to specify the
 required pointings for the observation. <p>

 Suppose the user requires three pointings along the long axis of a
 galaxy, at a half beam width spacing of 10 arcseconds. Let us assume the long axis of the
 galaxy has a position angle of 30 degrees on the sky. First enter the
 position angle in the "P.A." field. The rotated frame has axes
 labeled p and q, so in order to obtain the required pointings along
 our galaxy we require (p,q) offsets of (0,-10), (0,0) and (0,10). One
 adds a new pointing by clicking on the "new" button. One then modifies
 the offsets via the p and q boxes directly above the "new"
 button. The highlighted pointing can be removed using the "remove"
 button. The "Rm. all" button removes all of the user-added
 pointings. The arrow buttons to the right of the box displaying the
 pointings allow the pointings to be re-ordered. The highlight pointing
 can be advanced one position up or down the pointing list, or to the
 top or bottom of the list by clicking on these arrow buttons. For our
 example, the completed offset iterator will appear as show below. <p>

 <img src="het_images/het_offset1.gif" alt="The Offset Iterator (1)"><p>

  If you want to see what the rotated offsets are in the sky
  frame (which will be the co-ordinate frame specified in the "target
  information" element), click and hold the "Display Rotated Offsets"
  button.<p> 

  The offset iterator has the ability to automatically generate
  regularly spaced grids without the need to enter each pointing
  individually. The "Grid Pattern" section of the "Offset iterator"
  allows the user to specify the offset of the map centre (relative to
  the co-ordinate in the Target information box), the grid point
  spacing and the dimensions of the grid, in grid points. To create a
  3x3 grid, with a ten arcsecond spacing, one would fill in the fields
  of the grid pattern section as ilustrated below, and then click on
  either "Create" or "Create/Centre on Base" button. The pointings
  generated then appear in the pointing list box above. Notice that
  "Create" created a grid where the (0,0) point is at the top left
  hand corner of the map, whereas  "Create/Centre on Base" chooses the
  point the geometrical centre of the grid for the (0,0) position. This will only
  correspond to a pointing position for grids with odd p and q dimensions. The
  screenshot below show the result of clicking on the  "Create/Centre
  on Base position" - nine points with the (0,0) position corresponding
  to the map centre. <p>

<img src="het_images/het_offset2.gif" alt="The Offset Iterator(2)"><p>

<h3> Rasters </h3>

 The format of the position switched raster MSB is similar to the
    sample MSB, except that the "photom/sample" eye is replaced by the
    "scan/raster" eye. If you click on the "scan/raster" eye, you will
    be presented with options which enable you to set up your
    raster map. The "Area" panel on the left has a number of fields
    which allow you control the size and sampling of the raster
    map. The width and height of the map are set through the "width"
    and "height" records. The sample spacing and grid spacing and the
    postion angle of the map on the sky can also be set up by making
    entries in the appropriate records. Observers should refer to the
    JCMT User guide for more details on choosing sensible values for
    these numbers. <p>

<img src="het_images/het_raster.gif" alt="Rasters"><p>

  The sample time pull-down menu allows the user to set the amount of
 time data is taken for for each map "point" as the receiver is
 scanned across the sky.  The pull down menu labelled "No. of
 integrations" sets the number of complete raster map patterns carried
 out. The RMS noise of the final co-added map is also indicated. Note,
 one can either set the required number of map repeats here or leave
 this pull down menu at one and set the number of maps using the
 repeat iterator- the end result will be same. The rows per cal option
 allows the user to indicate how many raster rows should be completed
 before a hot/cold calibration is made. Depending on the receiver,
 observation and sky conditions, a hot/cold calibration should be
 performed regularly, say, once every 30, 60 or 90 minutes. <p>

<!-- ############################################################################ -->
 <h2><a name="het_freq_ed"> The frequency editor</a></h2>    

 While many users will simply complete the Het-setup component quite
 adequately following the procedure outlined above, the het-setup component includes the
 "frequency editor" tool which will prove useful to some observers -
 particularly those observing multiple spectral lines in a single
 program. To activate the tool simply, click on the "Show frequency
 Editor" button in the het-setup component.<p>


<img src="het_images/het_freq_ed.gif" alt="The frequency editor"><p>


 Starting at the top of the window we see a rectangle labelled LSB on
 the left and a rectangle labelled USB on the right. In between these
 two rectangle we have indication of the receiver IF frequency, the
 currently selected bandwidth and the resolution. Below these items there
 is a frequency scale and vertical lines indicating the position of
 astronomical spectral lines. Below this frequency scale is a plot indicating the
 atmospheric transmission as a function of frequency. Below this is a
 frequency scale labelled "FE frequency" and below this is a scale and
 slider labelled "LO1".<p>

  The chief idea of the frequency editor is to give a visual
  representation of the observing band selected for the receiver,
  together with an indication of the spectral lines visible in that
  band. To begin with, use the het-setup component to select RxB3, the
  CO(3-2) transition, and ssb operation observing with the lower
  sideband (lsb). Enter a velocity of 0 km/s. The frequency editor
  will now show USB rectangle greyed out, and the LSB rectangle
  highlighted. Try changing the bandwidth using the "BW" pull-down
  menu. Notice that the textured lilac rectangle in the middle of the LSB
  rectangle changes size, indicating the extent of the band on the
  frequency scale directly below. Notice also that a spectral line is
  highlighted in red at the centre of the band. This is the CO(3-2)
  line you selected before opening the frequency editor tool. Now select a
  bandwidth of 920 MHz. The band, indicated by the textured lilac
  rectangle, can be seen to encompass several other spectral lines. If
  you click and hold the right mouse button near the spectral lines, a menu will
  appear. Moving down the menu, still keeping the right mouse button
  held down, highlights the name of a spectral line on the menu and
  causes the corresponding spectral line to be highlighted in green on
  the frequency scale. This enables the identification of the spectral
  lines which may be visible in your chosen receiver passband.<p>

    The frequency scale at the bottom of the window, labelled "FE
   freq", corresponds to the observing frequency in the rest frame of
   the receiver. This is just the LO frequency plus/minus the IF
   frequency for the upper and lower sideband, respectively. The
   frequency scale immediately below the spectral lines is the "FE
   freq" doppler shifted by the velocity value and definition entered
   in the het-setup component. You will notice this scale will shift
   if you enter a non-zero velocity, and will also shift if you cahnge
   the velocity definition, e.g. from radio to optical. Note the
   frequency of the upper scale, lower scale and LO are only
   approximate because the correction from the receiver rest frame to
   the chosen rest frame cannot be made, since the time when the
   observation will be made is unknown. In fact, if you really enjoy
   working backwards, you can move the LO slider by dragging it while
   pressing the left and right mouse buttons simultaneously. As you
   might expect, this changes both frequency scales and the line rest
   frequency. Moving the LO slider can be a convenient means of choosing
   a band centre frequency such that particular spectral lines are
   included or excluded from your passband. Remember, for making the
   observation, the important parameters are the rest frequency,
   velocity, rest frame and velocity definition. These will be used to
   calculate the actual LO tuning at the time of observation, which
   will depend on the relative velocities of the receiver and the
   chosen rest frame at that time.<p>

     The frequency editor tool is particular useful when it comes to
     receivers operating in double sideband mode, where two differing
     sky frequencies end up with the same IF frequency. In this case,
     identifying spectral lines can be tricky since one does not know,
     <em> a priori</em>, which sideband they are from. Choose RxA, which has no
     sideband suppression capabilities, from the pull-down menu on the
     het-setup component. Notice that neither LSB nor USB rectangles
     are greyed out, indicating that lines from both sidebands may be
     visible in the IF passband. The apparent position of lines from
     the image sideband are a function both of the rest frequency and
     source velocity of the line chosen to be at the centre of the
     signal sideband. The frequency editor gives a useful graphical
     reperesentation of this effect, allowing one to either choose
     observing frequencies to avoid contamination, or identify unknown
     lines in the passband. The fact that the sky transmission and
     receiver noise are shown in the frequency editor tool allows the
     user to reliably choose between upper and lower sidebands when
     observing in SSB mode.<p>

     The frequency editor tool is also useful when using non-standard
     DAS configurations. As an example, choose NS_COHCN_125AB from the
     non-standard configuration menu. This mode is designed to allow
     the user to observe the CO(3-2) and HCN(4-3) lines simulataneously using the
     highest resolution 125 MHZ DAS mode. This is achieved by
     adjusting both the frontend LO frequency (to move the lines
     closer together) and the DAS LO frequency (to centre the
     subsystem on the two lines). In the frequency editor this is
     represented by a shifting of the bands covered within the LSB and
     USB sliders. You can use the spectral line identification menu to
     confirm that CO(3-2) appears in the lower sideband and upper
     sideband. Some DAS modes, e.g. NS_H2CO_125X4, use the different
     sub-bands of the DAS independently to provide a coverage useful
     for measuring two closely spaced lines accurately. If you choose
     one of these modes from the pull down menu, you will see that the
     coverage of the DAS subbands is represented by multiple LSB and
     USB sliders. If you select NS_H2CO_125X4, you should be able to
     confirm, using the line identification menu, that this
     configuration enables the simultanaeous observation of the H2CO
     lines at 218.22 GHz and 218.48 GHz with the highest DAS frequency
     resolution.  Please consult this <a
