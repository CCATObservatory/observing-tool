    <h1>Known Bugs</h1>

<p>
The JCMT-OT currently has a number of known bugs:
</p>


    <ul>
      <li>The RMS noise calculation for scan map is currently wrong (the time
	calculation is incorrect)</li>

      <li>The estimated duration of a polarimetry observation is currently too
      large for photometry and jiggle map polarimetry. The software assumes
      that a new data file is created for each move of the wave plate and so
      adds the startup overhead too many times.</li>

      <li>If you load an image into the position editor where the science
	position does not correspond to the image centre the science position
	will be drawn in the wrong place. Redraw the image (eg by zoom/unzoom)
	to fix the problem.</li>

    </ul>
