       <h2><a name="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>


<dl>


      <dt><a name="why"><em>Why do I have to do this</em>?</a><p>


      <dd> A variety of reasons. 

<ul>

<li>The OMP project is providing a software system, of which the
JCMT-OT is a necessary component, to manage flexible scheduling at
JCMT. Its purpose is to increase overall observing efficiency and
	    facilitate communication with the PIs, and at the same
	    time reduce the workload on our overworked queue
managers and TSSs. It will also allow you, the PI, to
control your observing strategy in a fashion similar to that of
classical scheduling.<p>

<li>The JCMT-OT has been chosen as the preparation software for all
heterodyne observing after the arrival of ACSIS. This means that we
	    can look forward 
to a unified user interface to all JAC observing, since the OT will be
the preparation tool for all JCMT instrumentation, as it already is for
all UKIRT instruments.<p>

</ul>

	<dt><a name="deadline"><em>What is the deadline for submissions?</em></a><p>


      <dd> There isn't one. However if you don't submit MSBs for your 
      sources
      by the time they are observable you could be throwing away
      opportunities of having your sources observed. Nevertheless, note
      that there is no requirement that you submit your entire project
      at once. Therefore you can submit some MSBs, wait for them to
      get done so you can analyze the results and then submit other
      MSBs to follow up on those results. Your MSBs will keep on being
      scheduled until you have exceeded the total time allocated to your
      project.
	<p>


	      <dt><a name="scheduling"><em>What happens to my MSBs
		    after I submit them?</em></a><p> 


	     <dd> During flexible observing, the observer/TSS will run
		  a tool called JCMT-QT (Query Tool) that allows them
		  to browse our database for suitable MSBs. The QT by
		  default returns as yet unobserved MSBs ranked by
		  TAG priority containing targets that are actually
		  observable, whose site quality requirements
		  match the current conditions and whose projects
		  still have allocated time left. However the
		  observer/TSS is able to use the QT to retrieve any
		    submitted MSB at their discretion.<p>


		  When an MSB is selected for actual execution, the
		  Query Tool can be used to retrieve it from our
		  database. The observer/TSS is then presented with a
		  list of the observations in that MSB and given the
		  opportunity to remove redundant calibrations from
		  the MSB or to defer them until a calibrator becomes
		  available. When they are satisfied that the MSB is
		  suitable for execution they send it off to the
		  instrument-specific control system.<p>


		  In ACSIS's case, the MSB is sent to a translator
		  which converts it into a complete set of
		  instructions for the telescope, receiver(s), and
		  correlator backend.<p>


		  The instructions are then placed in a queue that can be
		  processed. As the queue works its way down the
		  list it takes any sensible course of action,
		  such as prompting the observer/TSS when intervention
		  is needed.<p>


		  After the instructions have been carried out the MSB is
		  marked as done and will not be rescheduled unless it
		  is resubmitted from the JCMT-OT or marked Undone via
		  the project feedback system. 


	<p>


		  <dt><a name="msb"><em>What makes a good MSB?</em></a><p>


		  <dd>First the usual things, accurate co-ordinates, suitable
		    calibrations, good chop positions etc.<p>

		      The aspect of the MSB you most want to think
		      about is its 
	  length. Let's say you have been allocated one shift (8
	  hours) for a single source. Now, you could submit a single
	  8-hour MSB if you wanted. But that would be a very silly
	  thing to do. For one thing, if your source is not up for
	  more than eight hours, it would never be scheduled as our
	  software would detect that it would set before the MSB could be
	  completed. But even if your source was observable for 8
	  hours solid, the observer won't chose to undertake it except at
	  the very beginning of shift, which vastly decreases your scheduling
	  opportunities. <p>

	  At the other end of the scale, using up your 8 hours as 48
	  10-minute MSBs is a grossly inefficient use of telescope time. If
	  the 48 MSBs happen to be scheduled on different nights the
	  time spent on overheads will be huge. On the other hand, if
	  they all happen to be scheduled one after the other they
	  would have to be sent to the queue one by one,
	  thus driving the observer insane.  (But perhaps for
		      astronomers, that last statement is redundant.)<p>
	<p>
	  The golden mean? A 45-to-90 minute MSB, with 30-to-120
	  minutes still quite reasonable. If you believe your program
	  cannot be sensibly constructed in MSBs that fall in that
	  duration range please consult us for ideas.

	<p>


      <dt><a name="redundancy"><em>My MSBs only last half an hour so it is
      a waste to do a calibration for each one!</em></a>
    <p>
	
      <dd>Don't worry about this. The person doing the observing will
      have the choice of not doing calibrations that are highly
      redundant.
	<p>

      <dt><a name="library"><em>I want to do something that is not in the
      library</em></a>
	<p>

      <dd>You certainly can. However I suggest you let us know for two
      reasons. First, for your benefit, we'll be able to look your
      MSBs over to ensure that they will actually do what you intend. 
      Secondly, for our benefit, we would like the chance to
      create a library MSB that matches your observing mode in case
	    that will be useful to other users.<p>


	    <dt><a name="server"><em>What does this warning mean ? :
		  "Some of the observations in the MSB contained
		  default settings for the target information"
		  </em></a><p>



	<dd> You probably forgot to enter your co-ordinates! If you really
meant to observe 0:0:0, 0:0:0 just ignore it. <p>

<dt><a name="timeest"><em>I don't agree with the time estimates shown in the OT</em></a><p>


<dd>We are fine-tuning these, but they will always be just that -
estimates. However it doesn't really matter if they are a bit off. The
 estimates are used for two things. First, they allow the observer/TSS
 to plan the observing. For example, if they believe that the tau is
 going to change in the next hour, they can select an MSB that is
 estimated to last less than an hour.<p>

Second, time estimates are used to provisionally debit remaining time
during the night to keep a running tab on projects' use of their
allocation. However the final time accounting is done the next day
based on the actual time used by a project as derived from the data
files and logs. If you find you still have time left after that you
can submit an MSB to use it up.
