    <h1>Guide to the Library Contents</h1>

<p>
The libraries are provided to make preparing your observing program
fast and easy.  To open a library go to the "File ..." menu on the OT,
and select the one you need. There is currently 1 library is available:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>SCUBA</li>
</ul>


<p>The SCUBA library contains pre-defined observations that will be useful
when building SCUBA-based science programs. It is split into three parts:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><B>General MSBs</b></dt> 

      <dd>These MSBs will form the bulk of a science program. Pre-defined
      observations are provided for photometry, jiggle and scan-map
      observations for all filter combinations. Each MSB consists of a science
      observation and corresponding calibration. All you need to do is copy
      the MSB into your science program and edit the target information and
      the number of integrations.</dd>

      <dt><B>Miscellaneous observations</b></dt>


      <dd>These are observations that are not normally part of a science
      program. They include observations to determine the flat field and also
      to determine the instrumental polarization.</dd>

      <dt><B>Polarimetry MSBs</b></dt>

      <dd>Polarimetry MSBs are kept separate because they are slightly more
      complicated. MSBs are provided for all observing modes but only for
      limited filter combinations (the IP values are not at all certain at 450
      microns at the time of writing). Flux calibrations are included.</dd>

    </dl>

<p>
If you have any questions on these libraries do not hesitate to contact your
      support scientist for help.</p>
