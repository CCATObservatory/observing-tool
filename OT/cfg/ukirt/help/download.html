    <h1>Downloading the UKIRT Observing Tool</h1>

    <em>Existing users note: The current version is 20031224. If you are
    submitting observations for 04A you need to get this, or a newer,
    version of the OT. You may also need a newer version of Java (JRE).<p></em>



    <p>
      The UKIRT Observing tool is a Java application and has been
 tested on Linux, Solaris, Windows 2000 and Mac OS X to various
 degrees - our lead platform is Linux. It is the same package as the
 JCMT-OT so if you have the recent version of that you are ready to go.<p>



    <p>

     Go to the section describing your operating system.

<ul>
<li><a href="#unix">Linux or Solaris</a>
<li><a href="#windows">Windows 2000</a>
<li><a href="#macos">MacOS X</a>
</ul>      

      <h2><a name="unix">Linux or Solaris users</a></h2>

    You need three things to run the UKIRT-OT:

    <ol>
      <li> The Java Runtime environment (JRE) version 1.4 or newer
      <li> The Java Advanced Imaging extension (JAI) version 1.1.1 or newer
      <li> The UKIRT-OT itself
</ol>

If you are running java off the Starlink summer 2003 CD you already
have the first two, so skip to step 3 (UKIRT-OT). 

    <h3>JRE</h3>


    To check which version you have installed on your unix machine, type

<pre>
% java -version
</pre>
    <p>
If the answer is 1.4 you know you are ok as far as JRE is
concerned. Skip to the next step (JAI). 

If you get an older version or "command not found" you need to install
JRE and JAI. To simplify the hassle of installing both the JRE and JAI
we distribute tar files containing the combined JRE and JAI
packages. Versions are available for both <a
href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot/jdk1_4_ix86_Linux.tar.gz">Linux</a>
and <a
href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot/jdk1_4_sun4_Solaris.tar.gz">Solaris</a>
from the <a href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot">OT FTP
area</a>.</p>
	<p>This distribution can be installed simply by gunzipping and
	  untarring it. On Solaris:</p>

	<pre>
% gunzip -c jdk1_4_sun4_Solaris.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	</pre>

	<p>or on Linux:</p>

	<pre>
% tar zxvf jdk1_4_ix86_Linux.tar.gz
	</pre>

	<p>This will create a directory <tt>jdk</tt> in the current
	directory. This is all that is required to install it. You can
	now skip to step 3 (UKIRT-OT)</p>
    <p>

      <h3>JAI</h3>

If you have determined you have java 1.4 installed and want to check
if you have JAI, you have to look for a file called <tt>jai_core.jar</tt>. This
file will be in the java installation directory under the subdirectory
<tt>lib/ext</tt>

Here's an example of how to do it:
<pre>
% which java
/star/java/jre-1.4.1_02/bin/java
</pre>
This tells us that the java installation directory is
<tt>/star/java/jre-1.4.1_02/</tt>. So we would expect JAI to be in:
<pre>
 ls /star/java/jre-1.4.1_02/lib/ext/jai_core.jar
/star/java/jre-1.4.1_02/lib/ext/jai_core.jar
</pre>
which it is in this example.. 
    <p>

If it is not, you can get it directly from <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/index.jsp">Sun's JAI site</a>

<h3>UKIRT-OT</h3>


    <p>The most recent version of the OT is always available from the UKIRT-OT
    FTP area as <a
    href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot/ot_latest.tar.gz">ot_latest.tar.gz</a>. The
    first step is simply to download it and untar the distribution [it will
    take up 17MB of disk space, but this distribution also includes the
    UKIRT-OT]. It can be untarred using:</p>

<pre>
% gunzip -c ot_latest.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</pre>

    <p>This will create a directory called <tt>ompot</tt>. The installation is
      almost complete. If you have a java executable in your path you should
      now be able to run up the OT:
<pre>
% ompot/bin/ukirtot
</pre>

    <p>or add the directory <tt>ompot/bin</tt> to your PATH environment
      variable and then type:</p>
<pre>
% ukirtot
</pre>
<p>
      If the location of your Java executable is not present in the
      path then you will need to edit the startup script so that it
      knows which Java runtime environment to use (this is also useful
      if you want to force a site wide version). You do this by
      editing the file <tt>ompot/bin/ot</tt> and changing the line
      that says:</p>

<pre>
set JAVA = `which java`
</pre>

    <p>to (for example)</p>
<pre>
set JAVA = /star/java/jre/bin/java
</pre>

    <p>if you are going to use the Starlink JRE. Note that the value
    used includes the full path to the Java executable, not a
    directory specification.</p>

      <p>The OT should now be runnable as described above.</p>


<h2><a name="windows">Windows 2000 users</a></h2>

    You need three things to run the UKIRT-OT:

    <ol>
      <li> The Java Runtime environment (JRE) version 1.4 or newer
      <li> The Java Advanced Imaging extension (JAI) version 1.1.1 or newer
      <li> The UKIRT-OT itself
</ol>

<h3>JRE</h3>

If you have Java installed already you can check the version number by
doing <tt>Start->Run->Command</tt> and then typing <tt>java
-version</tt> at the MS-DOS prompt. If it is 1.4 or newer you are
done. If not you can get an appropriate version from our FTP site by
retrieving <a
href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot/j2re-1_4_1_06-windows-i586.exe">j2re-1_4_1_06-windows-i586.exe
</a>. 

<h3>JAI</h3>

If you have not installed the UKIRT-OT before chances are you won't
have JAI. You can get an appropriate version from our FTP site by
retrieving <a
href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot/jai-1_1_2-lib-windows-i586-jre.exe">jai-1_1_2-lib-windows-i586-jre.exe</a>
</a>.


<h3>UKIRT-OT</h3>


    <p>If you are running the OT on windows the distribution is
    available in both <a href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot/ot_latest.zip">.zip</a> 
and <a href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot/ot_latest.tar.gz">.tar.gz</a> format, you
    can just uncompress it using, for example, <a
    href="http://www.winzip.com">Winzip</a>. Once it has been
    uncompressed go into the directory <tt>ompot\bin\</tt> and click
    on the <pre>ukirtot</pre> batch icon. If you have a correctly
    installed JRE the OT will run without any further ado.</p>

    <p>You can get a desktop shortcut as follows: go into the
    directory <tt>ompot\bin\</tt>, right click on the <tt>ukirtot</tt>
    batch icon, and select &quot;copy&quot; from the resulting menu;
    then right-click on the desktop and select &quot;paste
    shortcut&quot;. optionally rename the shortcut by right-clicking
    on it and selecting &quot;rename&quot;.


<h2><a name="macos">MacOS X</a></h2>

     <p>The most recent version of the OT is always available from the UKIRT-OT
       FTP area as <a href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot/ukirt_ot_latest.sit">ukirt_ot_latest.sit</a>.
       The first step is simply to download it and expand it (upon downloading
       the expansion will probably be done for you). The OT application is
       named UKIRT-OT and can be started by double-clicking the icon.
       You may copy this application to any location you desire, and it is
       not necessary to download and install the JAI as these libraries are
       included in the application package.</p>

     <p>Note for OS X 10.3 (Panther) users: On upgrading from 10.2 to 10.3,
       some users have found that their Java installation is incomplete. This
       is evidenced by Java applications hanging, and the error message
       "HotSpot not at correct virtual address" appearing in the Console. If
       this is happening to you when attempting to run the OT, follow the
       instructions listed in <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2099.html">Technical
       Note TN2099</a>.<p>
