    <title>Scheduling Constraings Component</title>

    <p>

The scheduling constraints component allows you to:

<ul>

<li> specify a specific
time window in which you want your observations to be taken. Needless
to say setting this to narrowly will reduce your chances of being
	scheduled, so only do this if there is a valid scientific reason<p>

<li> set a rescheduling action, that will schedule an MSB that has
been completed to reappear after a certain number of days. If you have
been allocated time for a project that requires periodic monitoring,
	you may wish to ask us for more information on how this works. <p>


<li> by default, a target is considered observable if it is between 30
and 88 degrees of elevation for the entire duration of its MSB. If you
wish to specify a lower elevation criterion (eg. for a very low
	declination source) you may do so here.<p>


<li> restrict a target to being observed only before or after
transit. Again, note that this criterion will be applied for the
entire estimated duration of the MSB, so only do this if it is
	scientifically vital.<p>


</ul>
