<h2>Advanced Topics</h2>

So far we have described preparation using the library sequence "as
is". This section covers some topics of interest to anyone wishing to
manipulate or add to the standard library sequences in order to create
some of the less common observing modes that are sometimes
required. It assumes that you are familiar with the material presented
in the main part of the tutorial.

<h3><a name="placement">A note about placement</a></h3>

As you may have gathered by now, the Science Program is a tree structure and the placement of elements in that structure has a lot of significance<p>

      For example, look at the example below of a Science Program containing three MSBs - focus on the location of the two Site Quality components:<p>


    <img src="images/inheritance.gif" alt="Inheritance"><p>

What does this mean? The first Site Quality component is on the same
level of indentation, and therefore the same level of branching, as the
MSBs. If that was the only Site Quality component present <em> it
would apply to all MSBs in the Science Program</em>. As it is, the
first MSB has a site quality inside it (technically: within its
scope). So the first MSB will be scheduled using the criteria of the
Site Quality component inside it, and the second and third MSBs will
use the first Site Quality component since they lack one of their
own. The technical term for this behaviour is "inheritance" for those
familiar with it already.


<h3><a name="replication">Generating a programe from a catalogue file</a></h3>

If you have many sources which you wish to observe in a similar way
and do not wish to go through the rigmarole of editing a target
component for each one, there is a way to generate a science programme
from a template MSB and a text (ASCII) catalog file. This uses a
    service at our site - you need an internet connection to do this.<p>


Start with a
science program which contains a template MSB with a blank target
component (for example, a template MSB you have retrieved from the
SCUBA library). Your catalog file should be of the format:

<pre>
PKS0106         01 08 38.771 + 01 35 00.32 RJ
3C84            03 19 48.160 + 41 30 42.10 RJ
3C120           04 33 11.096 + 05 21 15.62 RJ
PKS0438         04 40 17.180 - 43 33 08.60 RJ

</pre>

The catalog format is not blank space sensitive - sourceplot and JCMT catalog
files will work as is, provided they do not contain planets or objects
    with orbital elements.<p>

Under the edit menu, there is an option called "Replicate from
      catalog". Choose this action:<p>

<img src="images/replicate.gif" alt="Replication"><p>

A file selector window will pop up which allows you to choose the
location of the catalog file. Once you have done this, the OT will
contact our site and after a short delay will pop up a new science
programme window containing multiple MSBs. So if you had an MSB with
one blank target component and a catalog file with 12 sources, you
will get back a science programme with 12 MSBs, whose target
      components have been filled in using the information from your catalog.<p>

Of course you may have to tweak the MSBs further, such as giving them
      more informative titles and tweaking the number of integrations on each source.<p>


<h3><a name="constraints">Additional Scheduling Constraints</a></h3>

You can place additional scheduling constraints on some or all of your
MSBs. To set up a scheduling constraint component for all your MSBs,
return to your science programme component at the top, then click on
"component" on the left icon bar as shown below. This will bring up a
number of choices - select "Sched.Constraints". This will drop in a
Scheduling Constraints component at the top of your programme, which
will therefore apply to all MSBs. To make this apply to only a
specific MSB, place the scheduling constraint inside it. 
    <p>
    <img src="images/constraints.gif" alt="Constraint"><p>


The scheduling constraints component allows you to:

<ul>

<li> specify a specific
time window in which you want your observations to be taken. Needless
to say setting this to narrowly will reduce your chances of being
	scheduled, so only do this if there is a valid scientific reason<p>

<li> set a rescheduling action, that will schedule an MSB that has
been completed to reappear after a certain number of days. If you have
been allocated time for a project that requires periodic monitoring,
	you may wish to ask us for more information on how this works. <p>


<li> by default, a target is considered observable if it is between 30
and 88 degrees of elevation for the entire duration of its MSB. If you
wish to specify a lower elevation criterion (eg. for a very low
	declination source) you may do so here.<p>


<li> restrict a target to being observed only before or after
transit. Again, note that this criterion will be applied for the
entire estimated duration of the MSB, so only do this if it is
	scientifically vital.<p>


</ul>

<h3><a name="andor">OR and AND Folders</a></h3>

 Within a science program, you can use OR and AND folders to group your MSBs.  These folders can be very useful
 for organising and managing your observing programme as the semester progresses.<p>

  An OR folder can contain N items, and you can set the "Select"
  counter on the OR folder to indicate that you'd like any subset of
  size M to be observed.  For example, if you wanted to try to
 detect the CO line in an object, but were not concerned in which
 transition (either 3-2 or 2-1), one could use a top level OR folder
 which contained a target information component and two MSBs as shown
  below. The user should set the "Select" counter of the OR folder to 1
  to indicate that just 1 of the MSBs should be executed (not both). <p>

<img src="images/or_example.gif" alt="or example"><p>

  Another application of OR folders is managing available telescope
 time for projects with a large number of potential targets. Suppose
 an observer wants to observe from a sample of 40 potential
 targets. Further suppose that some of the objects will require follow
 up observations towards the end of a semester and telescope time is
 somewhat limited (i.e. not enough to observe them all once and follow
 up the interesting ones). One solution would be to put the 40 MSBs
 for the sample into an OR folder, then set the "select" switch to,
 say, 10 objects. This will mean that no more than 10 objects will be
 observed from the sample. This can be used to ensure that all of the
 telescope does not get used up in making first observations, and that
 some time will be left over for follow up observations. This kind of
 programme management can involve the observer, in conjunction with
 the support astronomer, dynamically altering the programme in the
 light of past observations, results of data reduction and available
 telescope time.<p>


  An AND folder <strong>does not</strong> influence the availability of its contents, as an OR folder can, once an MSB inside it has been observed.  Instead, they simply enable observations to be grouped together. In the example
  below, AND folders are used to indicate that the observer would
  prefer to end up with observations A and B or X and Y rather than A
  and X and A and Y.  The order of observations, and which
  get done, will still depend only on project priority, source availability
  and weather. If the observer absolutely needs two targets observed
  to get any meaningful scientific result, they should go in the same
  MSB rather than in an AND folder - do not forget MSBs are allowed to
  contain multiple targets. <p>

<img src="images/and_example.gif" alt="and example"><p>

An alternative use for an AND folder might be to avoid having to reproduce information that is common to several MSBs - the site quality component, for example.  An individual component can be pulled out of the MSBs and set into the hierarchy at the AND folder level.  In the following example, we have been allocated both bands 1 and 2 for our project; however, because of differences in their expected fluxes we want to observe targets A and B in band 1 and targets C and D in band 2.<p>

<h3><a name="survey">Survey Container</a></h3>

<p>The survey container is an extremely useful tool when you want to
      carry out the same type of observations of a large number of
      sources.

<h3><a name="proxy">To those behind a firewall: Setting your proxy server</a></h3>

If your host is behind a firewall, you may need to use a proxy server
to access remote catalogs via HTTP. This can be achieved by selecting
"preferences" from the OT "File" menu and then selecting the Proxy
server tab. You may then enter the name and port of your proxy server.
