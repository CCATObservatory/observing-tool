<h2>Survey Component gemini.sp.obsComp.SpSurveyObsComp</h2>

<h3>Vector gemini.sp.obsComp.SpSurveyObsComp._telescopeObsCompVectour containing gemini.sp.obsComp.SpTelescopeObsComp items</h3>

The survey component gemini.sp.obsComp.SpSurveyObsComp contains target information components
(gemini.sp.obsComp.SpTelescopeObsComp) in a Vector:

<pre>
  private Vector _telescopeObsCompVector;
</pre>

The SpTelescopeObsComp items in this Vector are not normal SpItem <i>children</i> of the
SpSurveyObsComp item, i.e. they are not included in the Enumeration returned
by the SpSurveyObsComp.children() method. Similarly, The SpSurveyObsComp item
is not returned by the SpTelescopeObsComp.parent() method of the
SpTelescopeObsComp items. There parent field is not used. This breaks the
usual SpItem tree paradigm. To use the gemini.sp.SpTreeMan functionality in
connection with SpTelescopeObsComp items contained in
SpSurveyObsComp._telescopeObsCompVector the SpTreeMan methods should be
applied the containing SpSurveyObsComp which is returned by

<pre>
gemini.sp.obsComp.SpTelescopeObsComp.getSurveyComponent()
</pre>

The appropriate result for the SpTelescopeObsComp
item contained in SpSurveyObsComp._telescopeObsCompVector should then be
inferred (see implementation of jsky.app.ot.tpe.TpeManager.findRootItem(gemini.sp.SpItem)
as an example).

<h4>XML SpTelescopeObsComp items in SpSurveyObsComp._telescopeObsCompVector</h4>

<h3>gemini.sp.obsComp.SpSurveyObsComp, gemini.sp.SpObsContextItem,
gemini.sp.SpObsData and the Telescope Position Editor (TPE)</h3>

OT components are associated with an SpObsContextItem and its SpObsData which
contain the x, y coordinates of one base position.
The TPE uses this information. Initially this lead to problems: while a
SpSurveyObsComp is associated with one SpObsContextItem and SpObsData object
which contains x, y coordinates of one base position, the SpSurveyObsComp
itself contains multiple base positions and the TPE should be able to display
all of these depending on which of the pointings is selected in the
ot.editor.EdCompSurvey editor. To solve the problem a field
<pre>
  private SpObsData _obsData = null;
</pre>
was added to gemini.sp.obsComp.SpTelescopeObsComp. This is only used when the
SpTelescopeObsComp object is contained in a SpSurveyObsComp. In that case it
uses its own _obsData object (which is returned by the overridden getObsData()
method) with its own x, y coordinates for its base position.

<h3>Menu File -&gt; Save Observation As Sequence</h3>

If the menu "File" -&gt; "Save Observation As Sequence" is applied to an
observation (SpObs) that contains a survey component (SpSurveyObsComp) but no
target information component (target list, SpTelescopeObsComp) then the translator
uses the SpTelescopeObsComp that is selected in the survey component, i.e.

<pre>
// Find the target list.
         targetComponent = (SpTelescopeObsComp) SpTreeMan.findTargetList( spObs );

// If there is no target list then look for a survey component and use its selected target list
         if(targetComponent == null) {
            SpSurveyObsComp surveyObsComp = (SpSurveyObsComp)SpTreeMan.findSurveyComp(spObs);

            if(surveyObsComp != null) {
               targetComponent = surveyObsComp.getSpTelescopeObsComp(surveyObsComp.getSelectedTelObsComp());
            }
         }
</pre>

<h2>Telescope Position Editor resize bug</h2>
This is a bug which causes the
TelescopePosEditor to shrink every time the OT is restarted. This bug
appears only if the width of the TelescopePosEditorToolBar exceeds a
certain value. Somehow the code managing the size of TelescopePosEditor
(see {@link jsky.util.Preferences.manageSize(java.swing.JComponent,java.awt.Dimension,java.lang.String)}
does not take the increase width into account.

The bug was fixed by increasing the width in the JSky Preference class before exiting the OT. So when the OT is
started again it decreases the width of the TelescopePosEditor editor by the same amount resulting in the correct
width. This solution is a bit of a hack but it did not seem easy to fix this problem properly in the OT code
without having to modify the JSky code.

This bug became more of a problem when the button size of the TPE tool bar view buttons increased with the
introduction of a "WFCAM Autoguider" button.

See jsky.app.ot.tpe.TelescopePosEditor.adjustWidthPreference().
