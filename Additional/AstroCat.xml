  This document describes the top level catalog directory and lists
  the names and types of the catalogs that will appear in the user
  interface menus. The path attribute of a catalog element points to a
  file containing a detailed description. Catalogs with no path
  attribute refer to catalogs that are defined elsewhere, such as in
  one of the catalog subdirectories (see "Skycat Catalogs" below).
