How to prepare an OT release

- Remove install/bin/* and copy in the tweaked files
  from this directory [these include jcmtot/ukirtot batch and csh
  files and tweaked .bat files that dont need command line arguments]
  Also have removed SERVER= line

- remove install/cfg/om install/cfg/odb

- remove install/cfg/ukirt/*.lib

- remove the CVS directories (from the install tree)

  find . -name CVS -exec rm -rf {} \;

- tar it up

  tar zcvhf ot_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz ompot
