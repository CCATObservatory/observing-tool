    <h1>Downloading the UKIRT Observing Tool</h1>

    <em>Existing users note: The current version is 20030701. If you are
    submitting observations for 03B you need to get this, or a newer,
    version. <p></em>



    <p>The UKIRT Observing tool (OT) can be downloaded from the Joint Astronomy
    Centre FTP server at <a
    href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot">ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot</a>.
      It is distributed in two parts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#jre">A Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</a></li>
      <li><a href="#ot">The Observing Tool</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The UKIRT Observing tool is a Java application and has been tested on
      Linux, Solaris and Windows 2000.</p>

    <h2><a name="jre">Installing the Java Runtime Environment</a></h2>

    <p>The OT requires the Java Runtime Environment v1.3.1 (or newer) and the
    Java Advanced Imaging extension v1.1.1. They must be installed on your
    system before attempting to run the OT. There are three ways of obtaining
    these packages if you don't already have them installed:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>From Sun</b></dt>

      <dd><p>The primary source of Java is from <a
      href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>. This site hosts downloads
      for both <a
      href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/download.html">JRE1.3.1</a> (or <a
      href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html">JRE1.4</a>) and <a
      href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/downloads/download.html">JAI1.1.1</a>. Simply
      download it and follow the supplied instructions for installation. This
      is the recommended method for obtaining Windows version of Java (JRE and
      JAI).</p></dd>

      <dt><b>JAC FTP</b></dt>

      <dd><p>To simplify the difficulties of installing both the JRE and JAI
      we distribute tar files containing the combined JRE and JAI
      packages. Versions are available for both <a
      href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot/jdk1_3_ix86_Linux.tar.gz">Linux</a>
      and <a
      href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot/jdk1_3_sun4_Solaris.tar.gz">Solaris</a>
      (Windows versions must be obtained from Sun) from the <a
      href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot">OT FTP area</a>.</p>

	<p>This distribution can be installed simply by gunzipping and
	  untarring it. On Solaris:</p>

	<pre>
% gunzip -c jdk1_3_sun4_Solaris.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	</pre>

	<p>or on Linux:</p>

	<pre>
% tar zxvf jdk1_3_ix86_Linux.tar.gz
	</pre>

	<p>This will create a directory <tt>jdk</tt> in the current
	  directory. This is all that is required to install it.</p>

	</dd>

      <dt><b>From Starlink</b></dt> 

      <dd><p>If you are running an Autumn 2002 <a
      href="http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk">Starlink</a> release or newer you
      already have a JRE installed that is suitable for running the OT. It
      will be in your path after a Starlink login. Alternatively you can
      download the Starlink JRE package (which includes JAI) from the <a
      href="http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/cgi-store/ftpform1?jre">Starlink
      software store</a>.</p>

	<blockquote><B>IMPORTANT!</B> If you are running a Spring 2002 <a
	href="http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk">Starlink</a> distribution you
	already have JRE1.3.1 installed in
	<tt>/star/java/jre-1.3.1_02/bin/java</tt> (this will vary depending on
	where you installed the Starlink software) but the Spring 2002
	Starlink distribution does <em>not</em> include the JAI extension. You
	can either download that separately from <a
	href="http://java.sun.com">Sun</a> (see the previous note) or run the
	OT without the JAI (the OT will run fine but you will not be able to
	use the position
	editor).</blockquote></dd>

      <p>


    </dl>

    <p>We have tested the OT with JRE1.4.1 and it seems to work fine.</p>

    <h2><a name="ot">Installing the OT</a></h2>

    <p>The most recent version of the OT is always available from the UKIRT-OT
    FTP area as <a
    href="ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/ukirtot/ot_latest.tar.gz">ot_latest.tar.gz</a>. The
    first step is simply to download it and untar the distribution [it will
    take up 17MB of disk space, but this distribution also includes the
    UKIRT-OT]. It can be untarred using:</p>

<pre>
% gunzip -c ot_latest.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</pre>

    <p>This will create a directory called <tt>ompot</tt>. The installation is
      almost complete. If you have a java executable in your path you should
      now be able to run up the OT:
<pre>
% ompot/bin/ukirtot
</pre>

    <p>or add the directory <tt>ompot/bin</tt> to your PATH environment
      variable and then type:</p>
<pre>
% ukirtot
</pre>
<p>
      If the location of your Java executable is not present in the path then
	you will need to edit the startup script so that it knows
      which Java runtime environment to use (this is also useful if you want
	to force a site wide version). You do this by editing the file
      <tt>ompot/bin/ot</tt> and changing the line that says:</p>

<pre>
set JAVA = `which java`
</pre>

    <p>to (for example)</p>
<pre>
set JAVA = /star/java/jre/bin/java
</pre>

    <p>if you are going to use the Starlink JRE. Note that the value used
      includes the full path to the Java executable, not a directory specification.</p>

      <p>The OT should now be runnable as described above.</p>


    <p>You are now ready for the <a href="index.html">OT Primer</a>.</p>


    <h3>Windows users</h3>

    <p>If you are running the OT on windows, you can just uncompress it using,
    for example, <a href="http://www.winzip.com">Winzip</a>. Once it has been
    uncompressed go into the directory <tt>ompot\bin\</tt> and click on the
    <pre>ukirtot</pre> batch icon. If you have a correctly installed JRE the OT
    will run without any further ado.</p>

    <p>You can get a desktop shortcut as follows: go into the directory
    <tt>ompot\bin\</tt>, right click on the <tt>ukirtot</tt> batch icon, and select
    &quot;copy&quot; from the resulting menu; then right-click on the desktop and select
    &quot;paste shortcut&quot;. optionally rename the shortcut by right-clicking on it
    and selecting &quot;rename&quot;.
